It is a majestic isolated peak that rises above the Aletsch Glacier, the largest glacier in the Alps. The glacier is fed by several large icefields and curves downward for sixteen miles, ending high above the upper Rhine valley. The magnificent beauty of this area has sparked tourist development, including hotels along the glacier. The Aletschorn rises above a small lake which borders on the Aletsch Glacier. The mountain feeds both the lake and glacier with its own tributary glacier. Occasionally small icebergs detach themselves and float into the lake. Because of the isolation of this mountain, its summit provides incredible panoramic vistas, as well as strong, bitter cold winds.\nBest months for climbing: Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Bettmeralp or Blatten, Switzerland\n	\N	Technical Climb	4195	Aletschhorn	Switzerland	\N	Berner Oberland	1

Both Minya Konka (24,790 ft.) and Amne Machin were estimated by American botanical explorer Joseph Rock to be 30,000-footers. In Rock's 1930 article in National Geographic, his estimate was reduced to 28,000 feet to make it more believable, but a subsequent erroneous report from an American military pilot confirmed that a 30,000 foot peak did indeed exist in the Amne Machin Range. In 1949 the Amne Machin summit was climbed by a Chinese expedition from the Peking Geological Institute, who reported its true height to be 23,491 feet. It was later revealed, however, that the Chinese party had climbed the wrong peak, and had measured it incorrectly. The peak that they had climbed actually measured 20,524 feet, only slightly smaller than Amne Machin. The Chinese blunder was concealed until 1980, when the Chinese Mountaineering Association finally announced that Amne Machin was still unclimbed. The following year, the Chinese government opened its doors to one of the first foreign climbing expeditions ever permitted in their country. This was a United States party who successfully sent Galen Rowell, Harold Knutsen, and Kim Scmitz to the summit.\nBest months for climbing: Jun, Jul, Aug\nConvenient Center: Xining, China\n	\N	Major Mountain Expedition	6282	Amne Machin	China	\N	\N	1

A relatively recent cone has developed inside the crater. This cone, called Vent Mountain, reaches 3,350 feet. Aniakchak Peak, the summit of the mountain, is a high peak on the crater's south rim, over 1000 feet above the crater floor. Lava flows, cinder cones, and exploding pits, not to mention a rich variety of plant and animal life, can all be seen in the area, all within the Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve. The park lies 450 miles south of Anchorage on the roadless Alaska Peninsula, and is one of the wildest and most remote areas in Alaska. Weather can be severe throughout the year.

Bannon\nNearest major airport: Boise, Idaho\ndescription: Borah Peak is the highest peak in Idaho. It rises in the Lost River Range, the highest in Idaho, a giant fault block rising suddenly from the Lost River Valley on the west with virtually no foothills. Borah Peak is a remote mountain in a remote dry range, where the sparse, dusty landscape supports little vegetation. Borah Peak is the only mountain in the range with an approaching road and a well traveled summit trail. Approx 20 miles north of Mackay on Id 93 take the Birch Springs access road for the popular southwest ridge trail. Be advised this is a massive mountain and the trail is very steep and straight (no switchbacks). This is the only non-technical route, but it features "Chickenout" ridge. A 100 yard long knife edge at about 11890 feet. There have been 3 deaths climbing Borah which is a low figure considering the number of people who attempt this peak each season. In Novenber of 1977, two climbers from Idaho Falls were swept off and killed in an avalanche and in 1987, a Boise climber lost control of his glissade, fell over a cliff and died. Borah is not to be underestimated. The mountain was the epicenter of a major earthquake in 1983 (Richter Scale 7.3), which left some trenches and steep steps near the mountain's base on the Birch Springs access road. This quake also raised the range around 6 feet in relation to the valley floor.

It is also the nearest African mountain to any sea coast, as it rises from the waters of the Gulf of Guinea, a spectacular site when viewed from sea. The offshore island of Malabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea, is south of the mountain. On this island, another volcano, Pico de Santa Isabel, rises to 9,868 ft. (3,008 m.). The mountain's high summit crater is known as Great Camerron, Fako, or locally as Mongo-ma-Lobo, the Mountain of Thunder. A second distinct summit is the densely forested Little Cameroon (5,820 ft.). The entire massif is known locally as Mongo-mo-Ndemi, or Mountain of Greatness. Cameroon is home to some of the heaviest rains on earth, receiving hundreds of annual inches on the seaward side of the mountain. The highest reported precipitation was in the town of Debundja, which received 577 inches in 1919. The majority of Cameroon's rain falls in July, August, and September. The mountain has had a history of violent eruptions, including seven in the Twentieth Century. It erupted on March 28, 1999, for the first time since 1982.

The rock is poor and the approach is difficult, but because it is the highest of all peaks in the region, climbers have been active on the mountain for decades, and a variety of routes exist to the summit. The mountain's name has a long political history. Its name was Pik Garmo until 1933, when it was changed to Pik Stalin. In 1962, it was changed to Pik Kommunizma, and in 1998 to its current name, Pik Imeni Ismail Samani.

Its mile-long summit crest towers over 8,000 feet above a vast network of glacier-filled valleys, and three main peaks rise from the crest. Its isolated location near the west coast makes it vulnerable for sudden storms, which are often long and severe. Violent weather, crevasses, and avalanches have all taken lives on the mountain. The glaciers here are extensive, wrapping the entire mountain in ice. The most substantial of these is the Tasman Glacier, the longest glacier in New Zealand. The glacier flows along the eastern side of the mountain, where it is fed by several smaller glaciers, then continues south for over eighteen total miles. It starts in a large neve below Mt Elie de Beaumont and from there flows 18 miles to the south. it is replenished in its lower reaches by the spectacular hochstetter icefall which drains the Grand Plateau, an enourmous amphitheater of ice coming off the slopes of Mts Cook and Tasman (among others). Aoraki/Mount Cook became the official name of the mountain in 1998, combining the Māori and English names. Mount Cook Village is in a valley just south of the mountain. This is the hub for a tremendous variety of routes to the summit, including an increasingly popular Grand Traverse of all three summit peaks. Huts are plentiful throughout the mountain, particularly on the east slopes, which is the normal route. For the less technical mountain enthusiast, a popular trek is the Copland Track, a beautiful multi-day hike, with huts, from Mount Cook Village across the main divide of the Southern Alps, descending to rainforest on the western side and terminating on the main west coast highway near the Tasman Sea. Aoraki/Mount Cook lost 10 meters (33 feet) in elevation following a large rock avalanche on the East Face of the mountain on December 14, 1991. The avalanche left the summit undermined and unstable and further falls could reduce the height further.\nBest months for climbing: Feb, Mar\nConvenient Center: Mount Cook Village, New Zealand\n	\N	Basic Snow/Ice Climb	3754	Aoraki/Mount Cook	New Zealand	\N	South Island	1

The summit ridge partially encircles a small icefield that lies in the shadowed northern slopes. Beyond the icefield, this limestone mountain is considerably dry. Its slopes support no native trees, and running water is nonexistent. On the north side of Corno Grande there is the most southern glacier of Europe, named Calderone. It is also the only one of the Apennines.

Escobar\nNearest major airport: Quito, Ecuador\ndescription: Cotopaxi is the second highest mountain in Ecuador. For years Cotopaxi was the world's highest active volcano, however Chile's Tupungato (21,489 ft.) is a higher mountain, and awakened from its dormancy with an eruption in 1986. Cotopaxi is a symmetrical cone rising over 10,000 feet above the surrounding plateau. Although it is located fewer than fifty miles from the equator, the high precipitation of the region maintains a perpetual snow cap on the summit. The summit crater frequently releases steam, and eruptions have been well documented for several centuries. The earliest historical eruptions were in 1532 and 1533, and the mountain has erupted frequently since. The most violent eruptions were in 1742, 1743, 1744, 1746, 1768, 1803, and 1877. The eruption of 1744 was reportedly heard as distant as 500 miles away. The eruption of 1877 reportedly caused complete darkness at 8 am. in Quito, Ecuador's capital city. More recent but relatively minor eruptions have occurred throughout the twentieth century. The capital city of Quito is surrounded by towering volcanos, two of the highest being Cotopaxi (35 miles south) and Cayambe (40 miles northeast). Cotopaxi's proximity to the city, and its proximity to the Pan-American Highway, which runs twelve miles east of the mountain, makes this one of the most accessible high mountains in the Andes.\nBest months for climbing: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, Dec\nMost recent eruption: 1904\nConvenient Center: Quito, Ecuador\n	\N	Basic Snow/Ice Climb	5897	Cotopaxi	Ecuador	\N	Ecuador Andes	1

It is an enormous Himalayan massif, located in north central Nepal. It is the highest mountain located entirely within Nepal. After its discovery by the western world in 1808, it replaced Ecuador's Chimborazo (20,561 ft.) as the postulated highest mountain in the world. It maintained this standing for nearly 30 years, until the discovery of Kangchenjunga (28,169 ft.), which was then falsely believed to be the world's highest mountain. Dhaulagiri's crest stretches for thirty miles, lending structure to an otherwise tangled topography of twisting ridges, glaciers, and ice falls. Along the main crest, several pyramid-shaped peaks rise. Four of these summits, numbered from east to west, rise above 25,000 feet. In 1960, the Swiss/Austrian expedition who first reached the summit did so despite their airplane having crashed during the approach.

Its symmetrical snow-capped cone towers majestically near the Tasman Sea coast. Taranaki is the native Maori name for the mountain, which was ruled in court to be an equally valid name to Mount Egmont. Many maps now show both names for the mountain, since both are considered officially correct.?  Legendary thick forests once blanketed the mountain's lower slopes, but they exist today only in the higher elevations. The lower slopes have long been cleared, and today hold lush pastures used predominantly for dairy farming. The summit is perpetually snow-capped, and in winter ice ice blankets the entire mountain. The ascent is generally straightforward, but weather is quick to change, and the steep upper slopes are frequently icy. Egmont has a higher death toll than any other mountain in New Zealand, as inexperienced climbers often underestimate its dangers.\nBest months for climbing: Jan, Feb, Mar, Dec\nConvenient Center: Stratford, North Island\nVolcanic status: Dormant\n	\N	Walk up	2518	Mount Egmont (Taranaki)	New Zealand	\N	North Island	1

This mountain is the farthest east on the same crest that holds Jungfrau and Mönch. Of the three mountains, Eiger is the most spectacular. The first ascent of the Eiger was made by Swiss guides Christian Almer and Peter Bohren with Irishman Charles Barrington who climbed the west flank on August 11, 1858. The Eiger North Face towers over 5,000 feet. Several climbers have been killed on this face, including the two Germans who first tried ascending it in 1935. In the 1930's, the mountain became famous for its escalating death tolls, and was referred to by such names as "The White Spider", "The White Cobra", "Murder Wall", "Eiger Mordwand", and others. There are several routes to the summit of the Eiger, but all are very serious, even those which do not ascend via the North Wall. A railway and high elevation hotel shortens the approach, but the climb to the summit is no less severe. In 1936, another tragedy arose when an Austro-German group perished on the face. Hinterstoisser, Kurz, Angerer and Rainer all died on the face in adverse conditions. The lack of a fixed rope, laid at the Hinterstoisser traverse led to the party being trapped on the face, having to try a direct and difficult descent. The first successful ascent of the Eiger North Face was by a mixed Austrian German group in 1938 sustaining no fatalities. The group consisted of Andreas Heckmair (Germany), Ludwig Voerg (Germany), Fritz Kasparek (Austria) and Heinrich Harrer (Austria). Three years earlier, in 1935, the Germans, Karl Mehringer and Max Sedlmeyer froze to death at what is now known as 'Death Bivouac' ("Todesbiwak"), a position above the Flatiron ("Bügeleisen"). The White Spider is not a name for the face, merely an icefield of the face that lies near the top of the route and is reached via the Traverse of the Gods. It is so called as the snow filled cracks radiating from this icefield resemble the sinuous legs of a spider. Due to the reduced amount of rockfall and ice fall in winter, in recent years ascents of the Eiger North Face are often being tried in stable good weather periods, but in winter conditions. In contrast ascents via the Eiger west flank (normal route) or the Mittelegi ridge (east ridge) are usually done in the summer as both of these routes are very delicate in icy conditions.\nBest months for climbing: Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Grindelwald, Switzerland\n	\N	Technical Climb	3970	Eiger	Switzerland	\N	Berner Oberland	1

Though religious traditions have been severely curtailed throughout China, Emei Shan remains an important shrine for thousands of religious pilgrims. Its slopes once supported over 150 pagodas and temples, many built precariously above steep precipices before or during the sixth century. Some of the temples are still active today, and shelters are set up along the trail for pilgrims and tourists.

The first Erebus climbers in 1908 have documented their amazement in experiencing Erebus boil and steam above the icefields. These first climbers approached the summit from the west. A second ascent followed in 1912 from the north, but time on the summit was ended prematurely by a minor eruption. The most recent eruption was in 1995. The explorer J. Clark Ross, for whom Ross Island and Ross Ice Shelf were named, bestowed the name Erebus on both his ship and the mountain.

Its name, orignially Aitne, comes from the Greek word Aitho, meaning to burn. Etna is a large volcanic complex, located near the east coast of Sicily, just eighteen miles north of the city of Catnia. It is topped by a towering truncated cone, which contains an inner cone and main crater. Lateral eruptions have also formed over 200 subsidiary cones on the sides of the mountain. Etna's first documented eruption was in 1500 BC, since which time hundreds of eruptions have been recorded. Its most recent eruptive activity began on February 4, 1999.   Etna served as a setting for many events in Greek legends. Included among these is the first recorded ascent, that of  Empedocles, a Greek poet and philosopher in the fifth century B.C., who reportedly committed suicide by leaping into the summit crater. The mountain's lower slopes are cultivated with a tremendous variety of fruits, nuts and olives, as the slopes are extremely fertile. These areas are also densely populated. The higher elevations are forested, except for the final 3,000 feet, which are covered in lava, ashes and, through much of the year, snow.

It is an isolated volcano, located only 50 miles southwest from Tokyo, which contributes to its popularity. Thousands of climbers, tourists, and religious pilgrims ascend to the summit each year. The mountain has traditionally been sacred to the Shinto religion, and has remained sacred to Buddhists as Buddhism has become Japan's predominant religion. Three temples (plus a weather observatory) have been erected on the summit. No record exists of the first ascent of Fuji-san, but oral tradition states that a Buddhist monk first climbed the mountain in the seventh century. The mountain is now dormant, but it has erupted eighteen times in recorded history, and many more times according to geological evidence. The last eruption occurred in 1708. Perhaps ironically for a sacred mountain, the foothills have been developed as a summer and winter sports area, and skiing on the mountain is popular in the Winter. The majority of people who climb the mountain, however, do so with respect for its sanctity, and quiet meditation is common on its summit.

Sulheim\nNearest major airport: Bergen or Oslo, Norway\ndescription: Situated in the northern part of the Jotunheimen National Park, Galdhøpiggen is the highest mountain in Norway - indeed it is the highest point of Northern Europe. The usual route to the peak starts from Boverdal via a toll road to Juvasshytta close to the Summer Ski Centre. Accommodation is available at Juvasshytta if required. From here, regular guided group tours are run through the summer, ascending the peak via the Styggebreen glacier and an easy ridge of rocks and snow. The ascent is without difficulty but the glacier is crevassed and if not going with the guides the usual precautions must be taken. Another route ascends from Spiterstulen on the opposite side of the peak, which though a much longer route is again without technical difficulties.

It is a massive mountain comprised largely of granite (as its name implies), though much of the rock is rotten, and climbing is often on talus. Rock and weather conditions, combined with the a long approach and a steep summit, make Granite Peak one of the most difficult climbs of the state highpoints. Most parties take two to three days for an ascent. Climbing Granite Peak is a time consuming endeavor which should not be taken lightly. Although climbing Granite as a day hike is possible, most climb it as an overnighter using a high camp on Froze-To-Death Plateau or at Avalanche Lake. The easiest route to the summit involves a strenuous 10-12 mile hike followed by sections of exposed class 3 and 4 terrain. Although it is classified as a "scramble", the last 200 ft of climbing is extremely exposed and many who ascend this section use ropes and other technical equipment. This mountain is not recommended for the novice peak bagger and novices should gain experience on less challenging peaks before tackling Granite.

It is the most active volcano on the island, having erupted over twenty times since 1104. Some of the eruptions caused much loss of life. Major eruptions occurred in 1300, 1766, and 1947. The most recent eruption was in 1991. Because of its eruptive tendencies, Hekla is said in Icelandic folklore to be the gateway to Hell, and many local legends center upon its fierceness. New data! From http://volcano.und.nodak.edu. On 26 February 2000, Iceland's most famous volcano, Mt. Hekla, began erupting at 1819 GMT. The seismic networks of the Science Institute, University of Iceland and the Iceland Meteorological Office recorded a short-term precursory earthquake activity. A seismograph near the summit of Hekla beginning at 1700 detected small earthquakes. Thunder, lightening, and earth tremors accompanied the eruption. A 6-7 km long fissure appeared and a steam column rose nearly 15 km (45,000 feet) into the sky. A discontinuous curtain of fire emanated from the entire fissure. The lava flows down the slopes of Hekla and covers a large part of the Hekla ridge. One lava stream flowed from the eruptive fissure towards the north. A more active lava stream emanates from three craters near the southern end of the eruptive fissure. On February 27, this lava stream was several kilometers long and was advancing at a rate of about a meter per minute. The Coast Guard reported that the new lava covers a stretch of about 3-4 km at its longest. The maximum thickness of the ash sector, 21 km north of the volcano, was 4-5 cm when measured 7 hours after the onset of the eruption. Most of the ash fell in uninhabited areas in the interior of Iceland. The eruption reached its peak intensity in the first hour of the activity. Presently, the lava flows and ash fall pose little danger to human settlement. Geologists said the activity could continue for about a month.\nBest months for climbing: Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Vik, Iceland\nVolcanic status: Active\n	\N	Walk up	1491	Hekla	Iceland	\N	Iceland	1

The cross is comprised of a 1,500 foot vertical couloir, intersected horizontally by a 750-foot bench. Both of these features tend to collect more snow than the surrounding rock, so the cross tends to appear distinctly white. The cross formation can only be seen from the summit of Notch Mountain (13,237 ft.), a mountain which stands immediately east of Holy Cross. The mountain was discovered in 1869, and its notoriety progressively increased. Organized Christian pilgrimages to the mountain began in the 1920's, and by the 1930's these pilgrimages were attracting thousands of participants. Once a National Monument, it lost this status in 1950 when it was judged that the cross formation had lost much of its prominence through rockslides and erosion.

Schneider\nNearest major airport: Lima, Peru\ndescription: Huascarán is the highest mountain in Peru, and the fifth highest in South America. The continent's four higher mountains are all located further south along the Chile-Argentina crest, so Huascarán towers dominantly among its peers. Its two extinct volcanic summits (the lower north peak is 21,830 ft.) are separated by a huge deep saddle, upon which a hut now sits. The mountain is both high and massive, its huge flanks covered in steep, broken glaciers. In 1962 a hanging glacier broke from the mountain's northern flank, killing 6,000 people in the village of Ranrahirca. In 1970, a similar fate fell upon the villages of Yungay, Huaraz, and Aija, which were wiped out by earthquake-triggered avalanches from the mountain. Fifteen members of a Czech expedition were climbing Huascarán at the time, and were among the thousands dead. Many climbers have also been killed by icefall in the area between the two peaks. Technically, Huascarán is actually one of the easiest climbs in the Cordillera Blanca, though its ever-present hazards -- icefall, avalanche, and crevasse -- must not be overlooked. Huascarán's lower north summit was first climbed in 1908 by Annie Peck, making it one of the few major peaks in the world to be first ascended by a woman. The higher south peak remained unclimbed for 24 years after Peck's south peak ascent. Both peaks are climbed via the saddle that separates them, and the panorama from the top is unequaled. The lower north peak is less crowded, and is a slightly more difficult climb.\nBest months for climbing: May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Huaraz, Peru\n	\N	Basic Snow/Ice Climb	6768	Huascaran	Peru	\N	Peruvian Andes	1

Izta and its active neighboring volcano Popo are situated about ten miles apart. Both mountains are fewer than fifty miles southeast of Mexico City. The name Iztaccihuatl is Nahuatl (Aztec) for "White Woman", a name which has as its origins in an ancient legend in which Izta and Popo were once lovers, but were turned into mountains after displeasing the gods. Izta was turned into a mountain without life, and Popo was given eternal life, a curse of the highest magnitude in that forever he must gaze upon the extinct form of his beloved Izta. His anguish is to blame for the rumblings of the earth. In keeping with the legend, many locals recognize that the mountain's prominent features resemble the features of a woman sleeping on her back, particularly when seen from the west. There are mountain features which correspond to the hair, head, ear, neck, breast, belly, knees and feet, and when discussing the mountain, these anatomical terms are commonly used in reference to key landmarks and climbing routes. The standard route to the summit is known as "La Arista del Sol" ("The Ridge of the Sun") and climbs past the feet and up the knees across the stomach and onto the breasts. The ascent is not technical, but since the summit is over 17,000 feet, altitude is a consideration and climbers should take the time to acclimatize. The first recorded summit ascent was by James de Salis in 1889, but archaeological evidence indicates the mountain was previously climbed by Aztec and earlier cultures.\nBest months for climbing: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, Dec\nConvenient Center: Amecameca, Mexico\nVolcanic status: Extinct\n	\N	Walk up	5286	Iztaccihuatl	Mexico	\N	Cordillera Neovolcanica	1

Feuz\nNearest major airport: Calgary, Alberta\ndescription: You have heard me vary from the published books before regarding routes. This mountain is no exception. Take notes off the Internet, from summit logs, etc. The notes in The Selected Alpine Book cost me unnecessary hours in 2004. When you get to the gravel flats, cross over at a southwesterly angle and you will see Joffre on the right and Petain on the left, their views split by a protruding rock summit. This phenomenon makes it look like one and the same mountain. At this point, you want to make an angled elevated bee line for Joffre on the right. Ascend snow slopes, intermittent with rock croppings. You will top out over a glacier lake, move right around this lake and continue straight south for Joffre. Again, varying from the book tremendously, I recommend gaining a glacier ridge on the upper left side of the glacier and head straight for the lower left face. Here is where you have the choice of ascending the ridge via an ice/snow/rock gully on your left or heading straight up the North Face angling all the way to the right. Point avalanches take off below the summit rock buttresses, so the safest (and of course full of strong winds) route is the right side of the face. I used two axes at the steepest sections where I ran into intermittent ice. The summit is amazing of course, Assiniboine to the north, a huge perfect white sheet of the Petain Glacier to the south. This is (if you scramble at all in the Rockies, you are more than familiar with Joffre's unusual broad summit) a broad snow-ice summit with some rock exposed on the south side. Again, varying from the book considerably, if one ascends the north face, I believe the ridge should be avoided for descent and chose myself to glissade down the north face. I say this as it is difficult to descend something technical, when you never ascended it. And in early conditions, the gully to the ridge looked rather technical. The argument towards not descending the north face of course, is that you must be extremely confident in your self arrest capabilities. I made a quick descent all the way back to camp on the east side of Aster Lake. Because Selected Alpine Climbs recommends ascending the center of the Glacier, my entire route this day basically took me to every corner of the Mangin Glacier. Route finding skills are always essential in solo glacier travel and of course I would never recommend anyone traveling on a glacier solo. Just because I chose to do so this day, by no means makes it a safe consideration. The hike back out of camp the next day took us 4 hours.\nConvenient Center: Canmore, Alberta\n	Alberta/British Columbia	Technical Climb	3449	Mount Joffre	Canada	\N	Canadian Rockies	1

Its giant pyramid peak towers in isolation, 12,000 feet above the wide Concordia glacial field at the head of the Baltoro Glacier. The sheer icy summit is flanked by six equally steep ridges. Each of its faces presents a maze of precipices and overhangs. K2 was long considered unclimbable. Attempts in 1902, 1909, 1934, 1938, 1939 and 1953 all failed. The first successful ascent in 1954 started with over 500 porters, 11 climbers, and six scientists. One of the climbers died of pneumonia after 40 days of raging storms. The final ascent was made by a team of two after their oxygen supply had run out, and an emergency descent was made in darkness. K2 is the only major mountain in the world which has surveyor's notation as its common name (K stands for Karakoram, 2 means it was the second peak listed). T.G. Montgomery was the surveyor who assigned the peak this designation in 1856. The mountain's remoteness had rendered it invisible from any inhabited place, so apart from an occasional local reference as Chogori (meaning Great Mountain), it had no other name prior to Montgomery's survey. Since that time, the name Mount Godwin-Austen has occasionally been used, in honor of the man who directed the survey. For the most part, however, K2 has been the name of choice, and has even evolved into Ketu, the name used by the Balti people who act as porters in the region. Additional information added by Stephen Burke: With respect to the commentary on the 1954 Italian expedition that was the first to summit K2, it has since been proven that Compagnoni and Lacedelli did indeed have oxygen until they reached the summit of K2. The myth was dispelled through libel proceedings brought on by climber Walter Bonatti, who had been accused of sabotaging the expedition by keeping the oxygen for himself. The best evidence available in translated format can be found in the latest edition of The Mountains of My Life by Bonatti, or the short book entitled Trial on K2.\nBest months for climbing: Jun, Jul, Aug\nConvenient Center: Skardu, Pakistan\n	\N	Major Mountain Expedition	8612	K2	Pakistan/China	\N	Karakoram	1

Climbing the peak has never been permitted. However, religious pilgrims of all ages regularly practice parikarma, a sacred circuit of the mountain. The parikarma is a 34 mile, three day loop, over passes up to 18,600 feet. According to legend, a person who completes 108 circuits of the mountain will attain nirvana. The most zealous pilgrims make the entire circuit by performing a series of full prostrations, moving forward one body length at a time. The latter method takes three weeks. The Chinese stopped all pilgrimages for two decades after 1959, but today thousands of pilgrims have resumed the holy tradition, trekking overland for months to reach the base of the mountain.\nBest months for climbing: Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Barga, Tibet (small lakefront village, south of the mountain)\n	\N	Major Mountain Expedition	6714	Kailas	China	\N	Gangdisi Shanmai	1

From 1838 until 1849, it was believed to be the highest. It is an enormous mountain mass, and many satellite peaks rise from its narrow icy ridges. It is located on the border of Nepal and Sikkim, just 46 miles northwest of Darjeeling. It is the most easterly of the great 8,000 meter peaks of the Himalaya. Though not successfully climbed until 1955, it was first attempted in 1905, but four members of that international party were killed in an avalanche. The threat of avalanches and mudslides is omnipresent in the area, which receives very heavy precipitation throughout much of the year. As inspiring as Kangchenjunga's beauty is that at least the first three parties to ascend the mountain never attempted the final few feet to the summit out of voluntary respect for the Sikkimese, who consider the summit sacred. The successful British expedition of 1955 set the standard by stopping a few feet short of the actual summit, in honor of the local religion. The next two ascents were teams led respectively by India's Colonel N. Kumar in 1977, and by British climber Doug Scott in 1979. These parties also honored the tradition. Various origins of the name Kangchenjunga have been debated, but it is often translated as Five Treasuries of the Great Snow, a reference to the five high peaks that rise from the surrounding glaciers.\nBest months for climbing: Apr, May\nConvenient Center: Hille, Nepal via Dharan Bazar\n	\N	Major Mountain Expedition	8586	Kangchenjunga	Nepal/India	\N	Sikkim-Eastern Nepal Himalaya	1

Brocherel\nNearest major airport: Nairobi, Kenya\ndescription: Mount Kenya is the second highest mountain in Africa. Like Mount Kilimanjaro, it is an extinct volcano. It dominates the Central Kenyan highlands, towering just seventy miles north of Nairobi, and ten miles south of the Equator. The mountain was once much higher, but today it is a large dome, roughly 60 miles in diameter, from which rises the steep, eroded remains of its volcanic core. This summit is actually twin summits, a pair of rocky snow-capped peaks, Batian (17,057 ft./5199m) and Nelion (17,021 ft./5188m), separated by a narrow gap and surrounded by an intricate system of peaks and ridges, with many high glaciers. More technically difficult than Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya offers some of Africa's finest rock and ice climbing. Huts are available along the most common routes, but the more serious routes may require bivouacs. The mountain is heavily forested, and its ecological diversity is one of its primary attractions. A variety of plant life grows on the slopes, including camphor, cedar, and bamboo; while elephant, rhino, buffalo and leopard roam the surrounding areas.\nBest months for climbing: Jan, Feb, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Nanyuki, Kenya\nVolcanic status: Extinct\n	\N	Technical Climb	5199	Mount Kenya	Kenya	\N	East Central Kenya	1

"South" -- usually quoted at 7620 metres (25,000 feet), K.K. "West", at 7500 metres (24,606 feet), K.K. "East", at 7400 metres (24,278 feet), and K.K. "SouthEast", at 7320 metres (24,016 feet). [NOTE: Other authority cites K.K. "West" at 7350 metres (24,114 feet), and another map shows K.K "West" at 7850 metres (25,755 feet).] It would thus seem that the K.K. Group is quite complex and contains disputed heights; indeed, another authority (Wikipedia, in its summary of "Selected peaks in the Hispar Muztagh"), cites K.K. Main Peak at 7823m (25,666 ft); the Wikipedia entry for "Kunyang Chhish" itself, however, gives 7852m as the primary quoted height, but further states that the "height is also sometimes given as 7823m". Incidentally, Disteghil Sar I is likewise part of a Group, which has been quoted as containing Distegil Sar "II", at 7760 metres (25,459 feet), and Disteghil Sar III or "East" at 7700 metres (25,262 feet). [NOTE: The prior Peakware entry, which has apparently disappeared, stated that: "The great Khunyang Glacier in the Karakoram was not fully explored until 1938, at which time the awesome beauty of its eastern head was discovered. Here, great mountains tower on three sides above the glacier. Khianyang Kish is the highest peak to the glacier's south, and Disteghil Sar (25,838 ft.) is the highest on the north. Khiangyang Kish is characterized by difficult rock, ice walls and sharp ridges, with snow that is a maze of cornices and crevasses. The second attempt was in 1965, and a climber was killed when a narrow ridge collapsed at over 23,600 feet. Though cursed with bad fortune in these early attempts, climbers eventually succeeded in reaching the summit in 1971, and several parties have successfully climbed it since."] The Wikipedia source entry further notes that, inter alia, the peak is "notable for its rise above local terrain: for example, it rises almost 4000m above its southern base camp on the [glacier], and it rises 5500m above the Hunza valley... It is a steep, pointed, and complex peak; it easily rivals the slightly higher Disteghil Sar, which has a more rounded profile.... The first ascent was by [the Polish team led by Zawada] in 1971....however one of their members was killed in a crevasse accident. The second, and only other recorded ascent, climbed the Northwest Spur to the North Ridge... [and] two British climbers completed this route on July 11 1988. The [same] route had first been attempted in 1980, and had been attempted again in 1981, 1982, and 1987." Additionally, Wikipedia relates that the "Himalayan Index" lists three additional attempts in 2000 and 2003.\nBest months for climbing: Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Gilgit\n	\N	Major Mountain Expedition	7852	Khiangyang Kish	Pakistan	\N	Karakoram	1

However, recent Chinese sources, with confirmation by Japanese sources, place Kula Kangri entirely within China, with elevation 7538 metres, not 7554 metres, as traditionally quoted. The Chinese survey further establishes that Gangkar Punsum is higher, at 7570 metres, and that it lies on the border between China and Bhutan, although no boundary treaty has been concluded with Bhutan. Nevertheless, natural features argue in favor of Kula Kangri as being entirely within China, and at the lower quoted height than traditionally given. It remains for Bhutan to conduct its own survey if the confusion or doubt is to be removed. The traditional height of Gangkar Punsum is 7541 metres, not 7570, as the modern Chinese survey indicates. The divergence of opinion regarding Kula Kangri and Gangkar Punsum is heightend by the policy of Bhutan banning climbing of all mountains in Bhutan higher than 6000 metres since 1994, although a Japanese expedition claims to have reached Gangkar Punsum's North summit, known as Liangkang Kangri (7535m) in 1999, which is still on the Chinese side of the border as apparently regarded by China. Incidentally, the Latitude of Gangkar Punsum is believed to be 28.02.48 North, and Longitude 90.27.21 East, whereas Kula Kangri's is now quoted at 28.13.34 N, 90.36.4 E.\nBest months for climbing: Apr, May, Sep, Oct\nConvenient Center: Thimpu, Bhutan\n	\N	Major Mountain Expedition	7538	Kula Kangri	Bhutan	\N	Bhutan Himalaya	1

Pik Lenin is located on the border of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and is an extremely popular climbing peak. It is easily accessible, easily climbed, and the weather is commonly cooperative. Because of this, it is one of the most-climbed 7,000-meter peaks in the world.

The saddle that separates them, however, is only a 234 foot drop, so geologically this is actually a single mountain with twin peaks. In any case, the Maroon Bells are perhaps the most picturesque of Colorado's fourteeners, but they are also the most challenging, offering steep climbing on poor rock. A sign at the trailhead toward the Maroon Bells peaks reads: “The beautiful Maroon Bells, and their neighbor Pyramid Peak, have claimed many lives in the past few years. They are not extreme technical climbs, but they are unbelievably deceptive. The rock is downsloping, rotten, loose, and unstable. It kills quickly and without warning. The snowfields are treacherous, poorly consolidated, and no place for a novice climber. The gullies are death traps. Expert climbers who did not know the proper routes have died on these peaks.

As a result the summit elevation of Mt. Massive is up from 14,421' to 14,428'. That adjustment did not change any of the following information. Mount Massive is the 2nd highest mountain in Colorado, 3rd highest in the US outside of Alaska (behind Mt Whitney, CA & Mt Elbert, CO). It is truly a massive mountain, rising to a broad three mile summit crest, which holds five points over 14,000 feet. Massive has more area above 14,000 feet than any other mountain in the 48 contiguous states, narrowly edging Mt. Rainier in that category. The mountain, along with Mt. Elbert Colorado's highest(14,440'), forms much of the western skyline of Leadville, which is 11 miles east and slightly north. Like most of the 14'ers in the Sawatch Range, Mt Massive is not as well known or as photographed as Colorado's Maroon Bells, Mt Sneffels, or Longs Pk, neither does it display the jagged ridges of these. Still its impressive stature demands the respect and appreciation of any who have the fortune to climb it, photograph it, admire it from the top of surrounding peaks. The popular notion is that Mt. Massive is not a deadly or even particularly dangerous climb. However, it is a huge mountain that is often taken for granted. Generally, on Mt. Massive it snows in all months of the year, is quite windy, and during summer months the threat of severe lightning and thunder storms is an everyday danger. Any climbers should take these possible conditions into account before starting out.

Despite this impressive fact, Mauna Loa is the lower of Hawaii's two large volcanoes, the higher being Mauna Kea (13,796 ft.). There are two active craters associated with the mountain, one (Kilauea) located on its southeast flank, and another (Mokuaweoweo) located on the summit. Both are conatined with Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Kilauea is a huge bowl, whose level of volcanic activity fluctuates, and sometimes its crater floor is entirely exposed. Often, however, the crater is a deep cauldron of glowing red lava, and is a popular tourist attraction, particularly at night. Kilauea has an extensive history of eruptions throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, including an eruption in 1983 which blanketed 30,000 acres with lava, and created 180 acres of new land offshore. $62 million property damage was assessed from this eruption, and lava from the eruption continues to flow today. Mokuaweoweo, the summit crater, covers 3.7 square miles, and is over 4,000 feet deep. It too has a long eruptive history. Its eruptions have seldom been explosive, although a series of violent eruptions occurred in 1880-81 in which lava spread for over fifty miles.\nBest months for climbing: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec\nMost recent eruption: 2005, ongoing\nConvenient Center: Hilo, Hawaii\nVolcanic status: Active\n	\N	Walk up	4169	Mauna Loa	United States	Hawaii	\N	1

Five major ridges extend from the summit, and many spurs and buttresses extend from these. The mountain is increasingly known by its native name, Denali, which means The Great One in the Athabaskan language.

The mountain dominates the region in height, as few other peaks surpass 5000 meters. It is visible from Chengdu, Sichuan's capital city, 150 miles northwest of the mountain. The trek to the mountain holds spectacular scenery, winding through towns and hamlets that are seemingly as ancient as the mountains themselves. At 12,600 feet, a 600-year old Buddhist Lamasery (Gompa), rests at the base of the Minya Konka. Minya Konka was the first of two Chinese mountains to be wrongly measured in 1929 with elevations surpassing 30,000 feet. Both Minya Konka and Amne Machin (20,610 ft.) were estimated by American botanical explorer Joseph Rock to be 30,000-footers.\nBest months for climbing: Apr, May\nConvenient Center: Kanding, China (previously known as Tatsienlu)\n	\N	Major Mountain Expedition	7556	Minya Konka	China	\N	West Sichuan Ranges	1

It is the central summit of the three famous mountains on this crest, with Jungfrau to its west and Eiger to its east. Though Monch is a serious mountain of snow and ice, it offers a relatively straightforward ascent compared to its steep neighbors. Today railways take tourists near the summits of these mountains, and the Jungfraujoch Hotel has been built into the col that separates Jungfrau and Mönch. The Mönch lies on the border between the cantons of Valais and Bern, and is located west of Mönchsjoch (a 3,650 m high pass) and Mönchsjoch Hut and north of the Jungfraufirn and Ewigschneefäld, two affluents of the Great Aletsch Glacier. The north side of the Mönch forms a step wall above the Lauterbrunnen valley. The Jungfrau railway tunnel runs right under the summit at a height of approximately 3,300 meters. There are three routes to climb the mountain: The normal route from the Jungfraujoch, via the south east ridge: not difficult and short if you reach the Jungfraujoch with the train. It does include some very exposed ridge climbing both on snow and on rock. The summit is reached via a long walk on a thin corniche, watch out for wind induced snow accumulation and keep clear of the lee side. The northern or Nollen Route, which is a technical ice climb on a very long and exposed north face, with over 60 degree inclination on average and some vertical passages. It requires overnight bivouacking. The southwest ridge from Jungfraujoch. More difficult than the normal route via the south east ridge, but definitely not as radical as the Nollen route. Overall a very nice mountain to climb. The normal route can be accomplished in four hours if you are fast. The view is spectacular, especially on the south flowing Aletsch Glacier, the largest in the Alps.\nBest months for climbing: Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Grindelwald or Interlaken, Switzerland\n	\N	Basic Snow/Ice Climb	4107	Mönch	Switzerland	\N	Berner Oberland	1

It is ascended by a number of routes, many of which are fairly easy grades. The length and altitude of the ascent, however, coupled with the frequent instability of the weather, make Mont Blanc a very serious ascent, and over 1000 people have died on the mountain, largely because they failed to respect it, and failed to appreciate their own limitations. Two "normal" routes and several others can be used for ascending.

It rises on the Chile-Argentina border and dominates a landscape of high volcanoes that tower to the east of the Altacama Desert. Monte Pissis (22,241 ft.), South America's third highest mountain, rises nearby, to the south. Further south (roughly 350 miles), one finds the highest and fourth highest mountains, Aconcagua (22,841 ft.) and Mercedario (22,211 ft.). Because of its proximity to the desert, Ojos del Salado has little snow except in winter. A winter ascent is recommended because conditions are too dry otherwise. The mountain is extremely remote, and is difficult to access without renting a vehicle. The ascent is largely a walk-up, though there is a decent scramble on the final summit pitch which is best protected by the available fixed ropes or by a belay. Because it has no history of explosive eruptions, Ojos del Salado is categorized here as an 'extinct' volcano. However, solfataric activity was observed in 1937 and 1956, and more recently on November 14, 1994, when the mountain emitted an intermittent gray column of water vapor and solfataric gases.

It is the second highest peak in Mexico, behind Pico de Orizaba (18,405). The name Popocatepetl is Aztec for Smoking Mountain, and is often conveniently shortened to Popo. Popo and its neighboring volcano Iztaccihuatl (17,342 ft.) dominate the sky southeast of Mexico City. They are located less than fifty miles from the city, and are separated from each other by a ten-mile ridge. Popo's last major eruption was in 1947, although on December 21, 1994, it awakened from dormancy and continues to be active today. The first recorded ascent of Popocatepetl was by the Tecuanipas tribe in 1289. The first Spanish ascent of the mountain was an expedition led by Diego de Ordaz in 1519.  Emperor Moctezuma sent ten warriors to climb the mountain sometime between 1502 and 1519.

Several sharp peaks rise from this crest and from its many ridges. The long eastern face of the massif presents a formidable icy wall. The west ridge drops off comparatively gradually and is the normal route of ascent, though even this is steep and highly glaciated. Any ascent of the mountain requires climbing experience on steep ice and snow. Pumasillo was unclimbed until 1957, when Michael Gravina and Simon Clark were the first to reach the summit, followed one day later by team members Wathen, Meldrum and Darbyshire, and two days later by Carslake and Longland.

It is the largest mountain of the Cascade range, and it is more glaciated than any other peak in the contiguous United States. Five glaciers originate on the summit, and there are many others that have developed in cirques on the mountain's slopes. The Emmons Glacier is the largest glacier in the contiguous United States, flowing six miles from the summit down the northeast slopes. Rainier's giant ice-cap often seems to float above the horizon when seen from Puget Sound, sixty miles away. Rainier's two ice-filled summit craters each support a network of ice caverns, carved by heat and volcanic emissions from inside the mountain. Mount Baker and Mount Wrangell are the only other peaks in North America who are known to support such phenomena. Despite the enormous amount of ice on Rainier, however, this is only part of the beauty. The slopes hold lush conifer forests, and above treeline, the glaciers are surrounded by alpine meadows that are decorated with vast stretches of wild flowers. A fifty-mile wildflower belt encircles the mountain at around 5,400 feet. The rock on the mountain tends to be friable, so most climbs are glacier climbs. Mount Rainier was named by Captain George Vancouver who reached Puget Sound in early May 1792 and became the first European to see the mountain. On May 7, Vancouver named it in honor of his friend, Admiral Peter Rainier.\nBest months for climbing: May, Jun, Jul, Aug\nMost recent eruption: possibly 1894\nConvenient Center: Paradise (south) or Sunrise (northeast)\nVolcanic status: Dormant\n	\N	Basic Snow/Ice Climb	4392	Mount Rainier	United States	Washington	Cascade Range	1

McCarthy, Conrad Kain\nNearest major airport: Calgary or Edmonton, Alberta\ndescription: The registration to climb Mount Robson is voluntary. The registration box was at the Berg Lake trailhead back in 1998. If you use it, make sure you sign out as well. From the Robson Provincial Park Visitor Center drive 2 km north to the Berg Lake trailhead. There was no fee for overnight parking here in 2003. There are six official campsites en route to the start of your climb, unless of course you are using a helicopter, in which case you really are not in need of this beta. It takes 4 km to reach Kinney Lake (campsite), a rather uneventful section except for Knowlton Falls. The trail continues across a gravel bar, where you have several water crossing options depending on the flow, up to Valley of a Thousand Falls including White Falls (campsite-nice!) and Emperor Falls (campsite). Now the route gets quite scenic as the Mist Glacier starts to come into view. Continue through some gravel flats to the southwest shores of Berg Lake (campsite). Travel along the west shore of Berg Lake to Campsite 5 which has a day shelter to store food and other items you do not need to take on the climb. This is an ideal first camp spot with spectacular views of the Berg Glacier breaking off into Berg Lake, thus the name. Route Description-Kain Face Continue on to Campsite 6 where you leave the trail and make way for the tongue of the Robson Glacier. Bypass a small tarn on the left hand side as you travel southeast up the moraine. We hopped on this exposed glacier (meaning the crevasses are quite exposed during the late summer months) fairly early, quickly fixed our crampons and went unroped up the Robson Glacier until progress was slowed by crevasses. We then moved back onto the east moraine to a bivy site on a small rock cropping below a massive rock tower called Extinguisher. Extinguisher Tower has a lot of rock fall and reminds you all night of where you are. We used this as our 2nd camp. Get an early start as you attack the deeper snow further up the Robson Glacier en route to some nasty seracs called the Mousetrap Icefall, in the Robson Cirque. Although the Mousetrap Icefall is not recommended in at least one guidebook, I found this section to be the most interesting and difficult climbing of the whole trip, and pondered what those who helicopter to the Dome were really accomplishing in terms of climbing. It is also the most direct route but requires solid ice climbing skills to move horizontally through these leaning ice obstacles. Avalanches were plentiful through this upper area and we noticed many of our old tracks wiped out on our return down the southeast ridge. Proceed to the Dome below the Kain Face and make camp. Wind and cold can be brutal at this bivy site (and it was for us). Get an early start and ice climb your way above the bergschrund and up the northeast face comprised of over 1000’ of vertical ice. Then follow the southeast ridge, containing a few technical spots, to the summit. On the descent back to the top of the Kain face, we had one fall. You must be confident in self arrest as this slope does drop almost to the valley floor on the southeast side. On descent from the Dome the next day, we took the southeast ridge down to the Resplendent col for some variation in the route. We set up several rappels along the ridge. It took us over 20 hours to make it back to the parking lot from the Dome. Most of the photos I have added to this site are from a 2003 snowshoe up to Robson Glacier. Better route photos will be forthcoming from more recent trips, I am sure.

Located about 45 miles south of Mount Rainier. Adams is an ancient, inactive volcano. Its snow capped cone is moderately eroded, and the eastern and western slopes of the mountain drop more suddenly than do the northern and southern slopes. The normal route ascends the mountain on the southern slope. The position of Mount Adams on the eastern side of the Cascades shelters it from the extremely heavy rainfall of the western side. This combined with its overall ease of access in the Mount Adams Wilderness Area combine to make it a popular ascent. (The following is a new posting by Darryl Lloyd 3/6/01) Based on recent USGS studies (1997), Mount Adams' most recent eruptions were about 1,000 years ago, consisting of localized ashfalls and a couple of half-mile-long lava flows high on Suksdorf and Battlement Ridges. Most of the mountain above timberline was constructed during the last part of the Ice Age, between 35,000 years and 10,000 years ago. It will "assuredly erupt again," according to Dr. Wes Hildreth of the USGS.\nBest months for climbing: May, Jun, Jul, Aug\nConvenient Center: Trout Lake, Washington\n	\N	Basic Snow/Ice Climb	3741	Mount Adams	United States	Washington	Cascade Range	1

The others are Ngauruhoe (7,516 ft.) and Tongariro (6,457 ft.). Although Ruapehu is the highest of the three, its true dominance comes in the form of mass: It is a great bulky mountain, that rises in a series of ridges to a broad plateau that is its summit. The summit is snow-covered, but holds a warm lake. Ruapehu is active, having erupted in 1988, September 1995, and July 1996. Of its two neighboring mountains, Ngauruhoe is the active one, having erupted as recently as 1977.

The area is included in Los Nevados National Park, and is easily accessible by road. It is probably the most popular climbing area in Colombia, as well as a popular ski spot in winter. Some snow remains on the mountain year-round. Nevado del Ruiz is not only the highest mountain in the region, but is one of the easiest to ascend, straight up the snowy west slope from a parking lot at the base of the mountain. A popular alternative is a traverse of Ruiz, Nevado de Santa Isabel, Nevado Quindio, and Nevado del Tolima, all of which top 5000 meters. Nevado del Ruiz is the northernmost peak in this north-south alignment of peaks, while Nevado del Tolima is the farthest south. A traverse of all four peaks requires about a week. More than 23,000 people were killed in Armero, Colombia when Nevado del Ruiz erupted on November 13, 1985. Following that eruption, the mountain remained continually active for several years, culminating in eruptions in 1991 and 1992.

It was the first of the giant Alaskan mountains to be discovered, and the first to be climbed (after eight attempts), and was long believed to be the highest mountain in North America. In actuality it is nearly 2000 feet smaller than is near neighbor to the north, Yukon's Mount Logan (19,550 ft.), and is also smaller in stature. When seen from the south, however, Mount Saint Elias is a truly spectacular mountain with awesome vertical relief. It also produces the largest single icefield in Alaska, called the Malaspina.

Its elevation today is more than 1,000 feet smaller than it was prior to its eruption, when it rose to 9,677 feet. The 1980 explosion blew 3,000 feet of elevation off the northern rim, destroyed surrounding forests, and either blew away or melted the mountain's many small glaciers. Following the eruption, 85,000 acres were preserved as the Mount Saint Helens National Volcanic Monument, where one can witness nature's healing process firsthand. The entire area provides fascinating exploration, and from the summit, one can peer over the rim into a crater that still houses a smoking, throbbing lava dome. Following a brief period of dormancy, the volcano resumed activity in 2004. Trails to the summit were closed temporarily, but a limited number of climbers were permitted access again in late 2006 despite ongoing low intensity eruptive activity. The mountain was named in honor of Baron St. Helens, Alleyne Fitzherbert, British ambassador to the Court of Madrid. Native names include Lawala Clough meaning Smoking Mountain, Low-We-Not-Thlat meaning Throwing up Smoke, and Low-We-Lat-Klah meaning The Smoking Mountain. Today inside the crater is a doughnut-shaped glacier that completely encircles the lava dome. The Crater Glacier is the youngest glacier on the planet and also the fastest growing glacier on the planet.\nBest months for climbing: Mar, Apr, May, Jun\nMost recent eruption: 2008\nConvenient Center: Amboy, Washington (National Monument headquarters)\n	\N	Walk up	2549	Mount Saint Helens	United States	Washington	Cascade Range	1

It is the highest mountain in the final southeastern stretch of the Karakoram, rising just fifty miles north of the city of Leh. At the time of its first successful ascent in 1973, it was the highest unclimbed peak in India, despite numerous attempts since it was first approached in 1947. Dangerous cornices, avalanches, crevasses, and general inhospitability of Sasir Kangri repeatedly forced the earlier parties off the mountain. [Note: the Peak Guardian is responsible for the following information.] Sasir Kangri stands in considerable isolation, with a stupendous prominence over its nearest neighboring peaks of over 2300 metres, at the far Eastern end of the Karakoram range, and is the last of its "giant" (over 25,000') peaks; the first ascent in 1973, supra, was made by a Indo-Tibetan team; the ascent of Sasir Kangri II West was accomplished in 1984 by an Indo-Japanese team. Subsequently, however, it was determined that the unclimbed peak of Sasir Kangri II East, at 7513m, is somewhat higher; it is noteworthy that Sasir Kangri II East remains unclimbed, and is, in fact, one of the highest unclimbed mountains in the world, after Gangkar Puensum and Zemu Gap Peak)(See Peakware's List of Highest Unclimbed Peaks; Wikipedia; Reference.com/Enclopedia/List of Highest Mountains, and Answers.com, inter alia, for further authority). Furthermore, mention should be made of the fact that Sasir Kangri and its subsidiary peaks are indisputably inside the Indian "Line of Conrol" established by the 1972 Simla Accord, whereas its next giant Karakoram neighbor, Saltoro Kangri, 7742m, and S. K. North, 7705m, (which is also believed to be unclimbed as of 2006, another of the World's highest unclimbed mountains) are in the highly disputed area between India and Pakistan as a consequence of the "Siachen Glacier War" (still-unresolved) and the "Kargil Conflict" of 1999, by which India gained some substantial measure of de facto control over the Saltoro Group (and, inter alia, the Teram Kangri and Rimo Groups) as a whole; moreover, Indian military climbing teams are reported to have made at least one ascent of Saltoro Kangri itself since then. Nevertheless, most authorities continue to classify Saltoro Kangri as within Pakistani territory. International climbing groups are nonetheless restricted to military/police joint expeditions, apparently under the aegis of the Indian authorities. This entire Siachen ("Rose") glacier area of the Karakoram remains one of the most highly militarized regions in the climbing world, and in the world at large today.\nBest months for climbing: Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Leh, India\n	\N	Major Mountain Expedition	7672	Sasir Kangri	India	\N	Karakoram	1

Its five glaciers descend from its upper northern and eastern slopes. There have been no certain historical eruptions, although an eruption in 1786, witnessed from sea, is generally believed today to have been Mount Shasta. Also of interest, Tule Lake, located roughly sixty miles northeast of the mountain, provides refuge to the largest concentration of migratory waterfowl on the North American continent.

Mount Sinai (Gebel Mûsa) is a mountain massif in the south central part of the peninsula, where the land tapirs into a triangular point, surrounded on two of its three sides by gulfs of the Red Sea. Mount Sinai is a barren rocky massif, rising from red sandy plains. Of its many peaks, some debate exists over which is the original Mount Sinai of Moses and Mohammed. The mountains with the most supporters in the debate are Gebel Mûsa (7,500 ft.), whose very name is Arabic for "Mountain of Moses," and Gebel Katherina (8,651 ft.), the massif's highest peak. Mount Sinai is not a spectacular peak, but its fame lies in its religious significance to Christians, Jews and Moslems. Moses is reported in Exodus to have received the word of God via a burning bush on this mountain, and to have received the Ten Commandments in a cave near the summit. Mount Sinai is also the place from which Mohammed ascended into Heaven. Both churches and mosques have been built on or around the mountain through the centuries. The most prominent is St. Catherine's Monastery, an impressive sixth century structure which occupies much of Jebel Musa from the base to 5,000 feet up its north side. Monks of the early centuries zealously carved 3,000 steps into the mountain, leading to the summit. This route gains 2500 feet in elevation from the monastery, climbing past large cypress trees and ancient ruins. A trail connects the summits of Musa and Katherina, and a small chapel stands atop the latter.

It dominates the area with its steep rocky faces, and is surrounded by massive granite buttresses and several secondary peaks. The normal route to the peak is via Imlil. The trek takes you through Sidi Chamharouch to the Toubkal Refuge at 3207 M run by the Club Alpine Francais. There is also a new refuge right alongside run by an Imlil resident. Another popular route is from the Lac d'Ifni via the Tizi-n-Ouanoums. From there you can either descend to one of the huts, or strike up the WSW ridge. However, the climb from the lake is long and harsh, so most opt for the easier option. Another much longer route is from Ijoukak, which is on the Tizi-n-Test road from Marrakech to Taroudant. It is a two or three day walk along beautiful valley systems, but is rarely travelled by non-Moroccans. There are a number of routes up the mountain, the most popular via the south col. The north col route is longer, but usually better underfoot, and has less traffic. The WSW ridge (Ouanoums) is a classic alpine ridge needing appropriate climbing equipment. There are no glaciers on the trails to the summit, although extensive snowfields are present late into the summer at higher elevations and on northern slopes. Fairly easy climb above 4000 M.

In 1976, Trisul became the first 7,000 meter peak to be descended from summit to snowline on skiis. Today it remains the most frequently climbed of India's 7,000 meter peaks. The entire Garhwal region is holy to Hindus, but Trisul's role in Hindu legend is unique. Trisul was said to be the trident of Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction and reproduction.

The Weisshorn deserves a fame and popularity equal to the Matterhorn, but we're just as glad if the shadow of its more famous neighbor keeps the crowds relatively low on this beautiful peak. Towering to 4506 meters, 14,780 feet, the Weisshorn is a massive 3 ridged pyramid, rising above the Zermatt valley downstream and to the north of the town. Its normal route via the East Ridge is physically and technically demanding, with long sections of 4th and easy 5th class, a tricky and exposed rock ridge requiring care and the occasional belay, and a summit snow or ice slope up to 45 degrees. The altitude is also a part of its challenge, and the vertical gain on summit day is significant at 1600 meters (5248 feet). Overall, the ascent is slightly harder than the Matterhorn, but, most climbers agree, of much higher quality.\nBest months for climbing: Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Randa, Switzerland\n	\N	Technical Climb	4504	Weisshorn	Switzerland	\N	Pennine Alps	1

It rises from the Owens Valley on the eastern border of the Sequoia National Park, where the majesty one would expect from a mountain of its standing is significantly abated by its position in a crowd of steeper, more formidable high peaks. Still, Whitney is a popular ascent, and its superior height becomes much more apparent from its summit. Interestingly, the highest point in the lower 48 states is only 85 miles from the lowest, Badwater Basin (-279 ft.), located in Death Valley. The distance is somewhat longer by scenic highway, but still requires little more than two hours of travel time. A trail leads to the summit of Mount Whitney, and a toilet has been installed to accommodate its crowds. Registration is required to climb the mountain, and daily restrictions have now been placed on the number of climbers allowed. There is a very popular 8.5 mile trail to the summit via the Pacific Crest Trail. There are also technical rock routes of moderate up the 2000 foot East Face.

Mulholland\nNearest major airport: Reno, Nevada,  Los Angeles, California\ndescription: Mount Williamson is the second highest mountain in California, located roughly five miles north of Mount Whitney (14,494 ft.), the highest. Mount Williamson is located one mile east of the main crest of the Sierra Nevada, and is a massive mountain, dominating its neighboring mountains, and dominating the western view for fifty miles along U.S. Highway 395. Additional text submitted by Brent Harder: Mt. Williamson is the second highest peak in California, only second to Mt. Whitney. From Highway 395 in the Owens Valley it can be seen for 50 miles. There are times of the year when the area is restricted, so be sure to check with the Mt. Whitney Ranger District Office in Lone Pine. Because of this restriction, climbing is only open from December 15th to July 15th. By far the worst part of this climb is the 10 mile approach from Shepherd Pass Trailhead to Shepherd Pass. It is recommended to climb Mt. Tyndal and Mt. Williamson once in the Shepard Pass area, since you have exerted the approach effort already. The standard West Face Route starts on the southern portion of the West face. The climber will enter a large chute and climb either snow (preferably) or skree for aproximately 1000 vertical feet. A broken rocky cliff stops progress and the crux of the climb is the final challenge. It is fairly easy yet exposed class 3 rock climbing for about one pitch. A rope and a few nuts may be useful here for protection. Once this pitch is compleated, the summit ridge is an easy scramble to the South (main) Summit to the right (Southeast).\nBest months for climbing: Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Lone Pine, California\n	\N	Scramble	4380	Mount Williamson	United States	California	Sierra Nevada	1

Its name locally is El Carnicero, which means Butcher and refers to the incredible knife-sharpness of its summit ridge. Beneath the summit, sharp ridges and tangled glaciers drop with awesome sheer faces. This is considered by many to be the most spectacular peak in South America. A second peak known as Yerupajá Chico (20,082 ft.) is equally rugged, rising steeply just north of the high peak. For many years prior to its first successful ascent in 1950, Yerupaj? was the highest unclimbed peak in the Western Hemisphere. Today an approach to the mountain from the west requires only two days on foot (36 km).  Mining development on the northern edge of the Cordillera will soon provide road access near the mountain, further eroding its remoteness.\nBest months for climbing: May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Chiquian, Peru\n	\N	Technical Climb	6634	Yerupaja	Peru	\N	Peruvian Andes	1

An atmospheric research station and a hotel are both situated near the top, and countless trails, two ski lifts, and a railroad all converge on the Zugspitze summit. Part added by J. Vranjes: Two standard climbing routes are from the south (Reintal) and the north-east (Höllental). The Reintal route in summer requires only basic walking gear. The attractive Höllental route starts from the willage Hammersbach (at around 750 meters above the see level) and it includes walking over glacier (almost without crevasses) and lengthy ferratas. Gear for this route: v-rope and helmet, eventually crampons too. There is an entrance fee of 3 Euro for the Höllental route, in Hoellentalklamm above Hammersbach. There is also the Jubiläumsgrat Ridge route which connects Alpspitze with Zugspitze.

The massif is located near the center of the Pyrenees, entirely in Spain. The second highest Pyrenean peak, Pico de Posets (11,073 ft.), rises a few miles to the west. It's easy to climb but usually both crampons and ice axe are advisable. The most usual path starts from Renclusa hut (on the North face). A small glacier with some crevices must be crossed. Another possibility is to start from Vallivierna Valley (South face) where you'll feel more comfortable if you don't like huge amounts of people when climbing.

The plan was for John, Ian and Ian's friend to do only Scott. Mitch, Matt and I would do both summits. We left the cars at 6:20am. We followed the old road just past the main N. Fork Skykomish River about 1/4 mile until the major washout. Then we headed up on the other side of the washout. It was very nice going in the old growth forest. We hit snow around 3200' and the snow was firm for a change. At around 4300', we traversed left across the basin and up to the NW ridge about 100' below the summit. The ridge was narrow and partially snow-covered. At this point we put a rope in and prusiked up. The rope work took about 1.5 hours to get the 6 of us to the summit. We stayed about 20-30 minutes. Mitch headed down first to set up a repel. We repelled about 50 to the snow. It was 12:15pm when the party split into two groups. My group was going for Hubbart. We looked over the options where to go. If we traversed high, we risked possible snow slab releases (some car-sized blocks were ready to release). The NW ridge did not have an easy way off into the basin. Mitch had a report from Grant that indicated at 4400' there was a way off. So we dropped to 4400' on the ridge. The snow was very soft and tough going. We dropped into the basin and traversed around 4200', then went up to 4700' where we found a problem. We needed to cross a deep cut (death-trap) gully. We fussed around quite a while on what to do. It looked like a route through could be made at ~4500 but if snow was to release, we would be in danger. We first choose a lower route. Matt scrambled up a possible route and found it did not go. It was getting around 3:30pm. We made the decision accept failure and go home. Matt and I put the rope away. Mitch was head out. When Matt and I headed out, Mitch and re-considered his options and decided to look higher for a route where we first rejected. He found something around 4500' that went. We all followed. Mitch said he would kick all the steps to the summit (and he did). We gained the ridge at 5100'. Matt/Mitch dumped their packs. I took my pack but tossed out most everything. We left the packs at 5:15pm. I was post-holing Mitch steps, so I took some time to fill-in prevent the additional"post-holing". I summited at 6:05, Matt at ~6:10. Matt and I stayed admiring the views and taking photos till 6:30pm. The views were tremendous. We could see the sound and all the Islands. We discussed a possible down route. We looked at following the W ridge till the saddle at 4300', then drop left and traverse. As we descended the ridge, we could see that it would not go. So we ascended up & over to Pt 4450, then dropped off the SW ridge. At around 4300' we hit a 30' cliff. We used the rope to repel. The repel had a 20' overhang (I did not like it that much). We continued following the ridge. This route had some bush but was not bad. At around 2000' we hit an old clearcut. We could hear Silver Creek (River) below. Upon reaching the creek, we looked for a crossing. We were not going to get across without a log. We found one log which was slanted and 20' above the creek. It had bark and I just went across with no problem. The others followed but seem happy when they reached the other side. We found the old road. Darkness had set in and we were forced to dug out the headlamps around 9:30pm. The old road is now used as a trail and we could see others had been in. We followed it about 2.5 miles to the car. Back to the car at 10:45pm. Another great trip but a little long.

It is the dominant mountain of the Sierra Blanca, looming majestically over the surrounding plains of Southern Colorado. Its neighboring peaks are Ellingwood Peak and Little Bear Peak (both fourteeners), Colorado's 43rd and 44th highest mountains respectively. The peaks are connected by long sharp ridges with spectacular rock faces. Most climbers try to supplement their Blanca climbs with a half-mile traverse to/from Ellingwood Peak on a high connecting ridge. All of South Central Colorado is a special place - remote and vast. Time seems non-existent here. Visiting Tibetans have commented on the scenery's reminding them of their homeland. The mountains are rugged and sudden, and feature some of the best climbing in Colorado in the Sierra Blanca and Sangro de Cristo ranges. Additional description courtesy aaron a. abeyta: While the easiest way up the peak is via the north ridge, there are several very technical routes on the south side. Blanca is the fourth highest peak in Colorado and the highest southern peak in the u.s. to find a higher peak to the south, you would have to travel to the volcanoes of Mexico. some interesting features of this peak include an almost sheer south face and two neighboring 14,000 ft. neighbors (Ellingwood & Little Bear). Usually Ellingwood and Blanca can be bagged on the same day, but to reach little bear via the knife edge ridge does require technical skill and equipment (ropes, harnesses etc.). in my opinion it is the most beautiful of Colorado's peaks. i am especially intrigued by the ridges which connect the three peaks. they seem to extend, almost symmetrically, like two arms defining the sky and the sheer walls which fall to either side. the peak is a sacred mountain of the Navajo. to me it is a sort of promised land. no cliché intended, but Blanca defines the valley it looks over. for a spirit to leave the valley, it would need to cross over Blanca's white peaks. so in that sense it is a promised land because it is the gate to that place we seek when climbing. adios. be well.\nBest months for climbing: Jun, Jul, Aug\nConvenient Center: Fort Garland, Blanca, or   Alamosa, CO\n	\N	Scramble	4372	Blanca Peak	United States	Colorado	Sangre de Cristo Range	1

Grays Peak is the ninth highest peak in Colorado, as well as the highest point on the Continental Divide in the continental US. There are several easy routes to the top of Grays Peak, the most popular being Stevens Gulch from the Northeast. Many people climb Grays Peak, descend 500 feet to a saddle, and then climb Torreys Peak (14,267). The round trip is about 8 miles and 3,600 feet of elevation gain. Additional text submitted by BJ Bjorklund Rather uneventful easy climb. Saw lots of mountain goats. I can't speak for other times of year, but when I did this peak in July, weather was good then a storm blew in quite rapidly covering the peak in clouds as I was at the summit. About 1/2 the climbers at the peak then chose to try to proceed to Torrey peak in the bad weather and 1/2 chose to call it a day and just do the one summit.

Its illustrious history, along with the tragic events surrounding the first winter attempts on the 500m West Face, have made the 'Matterhorn of Spain' a household name. Indeed, such is its fame inside Spain, that it seems quite remarkable that until recently it should have been so poorly known beyond. Almost without exception, the rock is an excellent, grey, mountain limestone, where water-worn grooves (canalizos), solution pockets, or finger pockets (hueveras) are often the answer to apparently blank walls and slabs. Friction is invariably superb, although due to the compact nature of the rock natural protection is sometimes hard to find. Bolts have alleviated this problem to some extent, but on some routes long run-outs are still to be expected.

The eastern route starts in Sembalun Lawang village (1180 m). It's almost impossible to follow the trail on your own in the lower parts; a guide is essential. Staff at the Wisma Cemara Siu Losmen (boarding house) will help you arranging a guide and porters. First you walk up and down for about 15 km to reach the slopes of the mountain. Then you climb another 4h very steep through sparse forrest to the crater rim (2650 m). The next day you should start at 3am to reach the summit at sunrise and to return to the campsite before the clouds come in. You can return to Sembalun Lawang the same day. Better option is to descend to the crater lake (2003 m) and stay one night at the hot springs near the lake.

The North-East Ridge and the North-East Face are included in "Walliser Alpen Die 100 Schoensten Touren" (Walliser Alps the 100 Finest Routes ) by Michel Vaucher with Gaston Rebuffat. The classic East Ridge ( Hohlaubgrat ) is the most popular route from the Britannia Hut.\nBest months for climbing: Jul, Aug\nConvenient Center: Saas Fee\n	\N	Basic Snow/Ice Climb	4027	Allalinhorn	Switzerland	\N	Pennine Alps	1

Ritter is one of the classic Sierra Nevada Peaks. Lying just south of Yosemite National Park and just west of the Mammoth Mountain ski area, it is approachable with a day's hike from the Agnew Meadows trailhead. Various routes up the mountain range in difficulty from class 2 and low class 3 snow and scrambling to difficult and dangerous class 4 and 5 technical rock climbs. For an illustrated description of one of the easier routes up Mt. Ritter, refer to the route description near the bottom of http://www.climber.org/Feature/lucky7/lucky7.html A quote from Muir regarding his first ascent in 1872 can be found near the top of the report, as well. The following information was submitted by Bob Oppermann: Easiest approach is from Lake Ediza. Take trail North out of Agnew Meadows. Take Shadow Lake Trail to Lake Ediza, which is located at end of the trail. When you arrive at Ediza, you will see two dominant peaks. They are Mt Banner on your right, and Mt Ritter on the left. Camp at far end of lake, near the inlet. For your approach, follow the inlet stream towards the Ritter-Banner Saddle. From this view, you want to aim towards the left side of the mountain. There are many ways to get to the top of the parallel bluff. Find a way, and angle towards where the glacier meets the mountain. A little ways beyond this point is a 3rd class couloir. Scramble up here, and follow your nose to the summit. My favorite view of the Sierra. On a clear day, you can see Half-Dome. I first summited this mountain on a memorable day in 1978 with my best-friend Dana Turman, and his brother Richard. Since then, I have climbed it 2 or 3 times. It is so magestic, towering above everything in sight. I hope you enjoy your journey to this wonderful mountain. I know that it is a place that I never get tired of.

The approach to the Trift Glacier / South-West Ridge (Triftgrat) route can now be made via lift to Hohsaas which is located virtually at the edge of the glacier. The ascent from Hohsaas takes about 4 hours and involves slopes to 40 degrees and crevasses. The North Ridge is included in "Walliser Alpen Die 100 Schoensten Touren" ( Walliser Alps the 100 Finest Routes ) by Michel Vaucher with Gaston Rebuffat. Additional Information provided by J. Vranjes: The other normal route (south-east approach) is totally different because it is free of glaciers and more importantly it is without any cable car lines. From the west side, the route starts at Saas Almagell village at around 1670 m above the sea level. The lower part of the route is through a pleasant pine forest and it passes the Almagelleralp hotel ar around 2200 m. After that one should follow the signs towards the Almageller hut (at 2894 m; 3.5 hours to the hut from the village). The route continues towards the Zwischbergen pass (3268 m) and from there it turns towards the north either along the snow-free rocky ridge or along the slope that is usually covered with snow. At around 3950 m one is again on snow and the direction is obvious, towards the north-east with the summit in sight all the time. Along this route the mountain can be climbed directly from the village in around 8 hours. Sleeping at the Almageller hut is a good alternative, it is a pleasant place with running water in the toilet. Some people camp in the rock below the Zwischbergen pass on its west side. From the east side the route starts at the Zwischbergen village and joins the route described above at the Zwischbergen pass. This is a considerably longer and snow-free approach in the summer time. As for the equipment, one is on the snow only above 3950 m when the route is not steep and one can manage without crampons, though having them is not a bad idea.\nBest months for climbing: Jul, Aug\nConvenient Center: Saas Grund\n	\N	Basic Snow/Ice Climb	4023	Weissmies	Switzerland	\N	Pennine Alps	1

The plan was for John, Ian and Ian's friend to do only Scott. Mitch, Matt and I would do both summits. We left the cars at 6:20am. We followed the old road just past the main N. Fork Skykomish River about 1/4 mile until the major washout. Then we headed up on the other side of the washout. It was very nice going in the old growth forest. We hit snow around 3200' and the snow was firm for a change. At around 4300', we traversed left across the basin and up to the NW ridge about 100' below the summit. The ridge was narrow and partially snow-covered. At this point we put a rope in and prusiked up. The rope work took about 1.5 hours to get the 6 of us to the summit. We stayed about 20-30 minutes. Mitch headed down first to set up a repel. We repelled about 50 to the snow. It was 12:15pm when the party split into two groups. My group was going for Hubbart. We looked over the options where to go. If we traversed high, we risked possible snow slab releases (some car-sized blocks were ready to release). The NW ridge did not have an easy way off into the basin. Mitch had a report from Grant that indicated at 4400' there was a way off. So we dropped to 4400' on the ridge. The snow was very soft and tough going. We dropped into the basin and traversed around 4200', then went up to 4700' where we found a problem. We needed to cross a deep cut (death-trap) gully. We fussed around quite a while on what to do. It looked like a route through could be made at ~4500 but if snow was to release, we would be in danger. We first choose a lower route. Matt scrambled up a possible route and found it did not go. It was getting around 3:30pm. We made the decision accept failure and go home. Matt and I put the rope away. Mitch was head out. When Matt and I headed out, Mitch and re-considered his options and decided to look higher for a route where we first rejected. He found something around 4500' that went. We all followed. Mitch said he would kick all the steps to the summit (and he did). We gained the ridge at 5100'. Matt/Mitch dumped their packs. I took my pack but tossed out most everything. We left the packs at 5:15pm. I was post-holing Mitch steps, so I took some time to fill-in prevent the additional"post-holing". I summited at 6:05, Matt at ~6:10. Matt and I stayed admiring the views and taking photos till 6:30pm. The views were tremendous. We could see the sound and all the Islands. We discussed a possible down route. We looked at following the W ridge till the saddle at 4300', then drop left and traverse. As we descended the ridge, we could see that it would not go. So we ascended up & over to Pt 4450, then dropped off the SW ridge. At around 4300' we hit a 30' cliff. We used the rope to repel. The repel had a 20' overhang (I did not like it that much). We continued following the ridge. This route had some bush but was not bad. At around 2000' we hit an old clearcut. We could hear Silver Creek (River) below. Upon reaching the creek, we looked for a crossing. We were not going to get across without a log. We found one log which was slanted and 20' above the creek. It had bark and I just went across with no problem. The others followed but seem happy when they reached the other side. We found the old road.

However, there is some dispute of its status as the seventh summit since it is located in the western half of the island of New Guinea, in the Indonesian province of Papua, and Indonesia is an Asian country. This is a minority viewpoint based on politics rather than geophysics. Puncak Jaya is indisputably the highest point between the Himalayas and the Andes. It is located in what is variously called the Sudirman Range or the Dugunduguoo, in the western central highlands of Papua, just fifty miles from the island's southern shore. Much of this range is characterized by easy terrace, surmounted by severe rock walls. While Puncak Jaya’s peak is free of glaciers, there are several on its slopes, including the Carstensz Glacier, the Meren Glacier, and Northwall Firn. Being equatorial, there is little variation in the mean temperature during the year (around 0.5°C) and the glaciers fluctuate on seasonal basis only slightly. Evidence from satellite imagery demonstrates that most of the glaciers atop the mountain are retreating rapidly and some have disappeared altogether the last twenty years.\nBest months for climbing: Feb, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov\nConvenient Center: Nabire\n	\N	Scramble	4884	Puncak Jaya	Indonesia	\N	Maoke Range	1

Our route has us heading toward the ridge to Round Mtn and near the crest, we headed left to the summit area. We ran into snow at about 3000', we put snowshoes on at ~4000'. When we got our first view of the east ridge, it did not look easy. It was mush steeper than I was led to believe. I thought to myself, what am I getting into! We made it to the base of the peak in 3.5 hours. We put on seat harnesses and proceeded on. I led one 80' pitch of wet mossy rock, snow and brush. I would rate it 5th class. I used the brush as much as possible since snow covered most of the route. I even climb a tree up 6' to step onto a ledge. I finally made it to a good belay spot. I was wondering if the others would club me with their Ice Axes because this was a terrible route. The two others seemed to climb up on top rope without problems. They seemed okay with the route. I was much more upset with the route than they. Of course they did not lead it, I did. We only encounter a 15 foot step rest of the way to the summit which was easy. We summited at 2:25pm. We had wonderful views of Whitehorse and Three Fingers and many other peaks to the East and North. It looks like Whitehorse has so much snow this year that the 60' face is now a walkup a ridge to the summit, no face to climb. The weather was Sunny with some clouds. Very little wind on the summit and I never put on more than one layer. We left the summit at 3:15pm. We down climbed to the top of the first pitch without problem. For the 15-foot step, we down climbed on belay. We did one 90' repel. I had Randy go first (he is an intermediate level climber). It took him a while to untangle the ropes. I went last and remove brush that could possibly hang up the rope. The ropes did not hang and we were down from the summit on safe ground in 2+ hours. The return went fast and we were back at the car at 7:00pm. I missed the car by 150 yards on the road. I was real happy we were all back safely.

He look at the map and started to assessing the situation. If he goes, he will be wasted for Sunday's trip. After a while of deliberation, he said he would be happy with Downey Mtn. We left the summit of Downey a little after noon. It was no problem descending to the col, then into the basin where we put snowshoes on. Mitch, MikeB and Dave enjoyed 2 hours on the summit. I would guess they were entertained by our progress as we continuing on and probably saying we were nuts. We choose to go to descend at the second col so the side-hilling and gain would be less. Around 1:00pm we crest the ridge and got are first views of Pilot. Wow. The views were super, picture postcard. However we had a bit of work to get Pilot. We determined the best route to be to contour to the ridge above Downey Lake, then follows the ridge to the summit. The snow was soft and it seemed to take forever to get to the ridge. We enjoy super views all the way. Once on the ridge, we made great time. At ~6400' below Pilot we debated taking snowshoes off and following ridge. We tested the snow conditions and it was too soft to go without snowshoes. We talked about scrambling the bare rock, it looked like fun but could cost us time. We followed just below the ridge crest with snowshoes for the next 300+ feet to the crest, then on to the summit. The views were absolutely wonderful. For the first time in the day, the wind pickup some and it was cool with one layer. We enjoyed summit for a while. Found a register indicating ascents in 70, 71, 94, and 95. No John Roper record??? At 5:45 it was time to leave. We follow the ridge back and then on to Pk 6640+. We reached this peak just before sunset. Another register was found with one person ascending the summit twice in a year. We waited anxiously for the color to appear. It was exciting to be in such a place at sunset, a rare moment in time. When can you sit on a summit in clear skies and fully winter beauty then watch a sunset. As sunset came, color faded. The color of the sunset was disappointing, Oh Well, until next time. We left the summit of Pk6640+ at 8:30. Greg was a bit worried how we would get back. Matt on the other hand was still whining about the lack of color. We took off the snowshoes and glissaded 1500'+ to the forest below. The moon was 3/4 and it provided lots of light. We came out below the un-named lake north of Downey Mtn. It was no problem to descend the forest with a headlamp. We found the trail that Beckey referenced shortly after we left the snow. This trail looked like a build trail (not on any of my old maps). It switchbacked to the Downey Creek trail. The trail is about 2 miles in and can be found about 3 minutes past the stream coming down from the westside of Downey Mtn. Its about 30' past a series of 4-6 cut old 2-foot+ logs. The trail heads up about 80', then switchbacks. We arrived back at the cars at 11:30pm. Everything basically went according to plan. Looking back, the worst part of the trip was coming back the Downey Creek Trail. Many big downed logs and several slides where the trail grade is lost. I think this trail is becoming lost and it should be re-designed as a "Route". I was tired but not trashed, yes, just tired. Our pace was not fast and we took plenty of breaks.

It is the highest and most massive peak in the east-west-trending Rabbit Ears Range which separates North and Middle Parks. Geologic mapping of Parkview Mountain shows the highest parts of the mountain to be a stock of quartz latite porphyry intruding the Middle Park Formation of Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary age. Two dike systems, composed of quartz latite porphyry dikes of pre-stock and post-stock ages are also present on the mountain. The post-stock dikes show a roughly radial pattern about the stock. A quartz monzonite intrusive not exposed in outcrop, but intersected by drilling is present at depth under the mountain. Minor copper, lead, zinc and silver mineralization occurs in brecciated and silicified contact zones and in veins in the area. In the late 1960's through the mid 1970's Parkview Mountain was studied for the potential of a molybdenum deposit.

Squire Cr required wading shoes and was painfully cold. Thereafter we had a nice open forest, bearing what I thought was an appropriate amount of flagging. OK, John, maybe those 2 big flourescent papers with "ROUTE" stenciled on them were a bit much. When the legendary brush began at 2800', we had a snow filled gully which led shortly to higher snow slopes, making for an essentially brushless approach. In 5 hours from the car we had reached the 5200' saddle on the Salish-Buckeye divide, where we dumped our overnight gear and prepared for the afternoon to Bullon. By now the perfect day had given way to high clouds moving in quickly. The 1200' drop to Bullon Lks went easily down a snow filled gully. The 1800' climb to Bullon presented more difficulty than we were led to expect. We took the only easy line, a gully which rose steeper and steeper til it reached 40 degrees at the top. The summit cairn was just barely melted out, but sporadic digging revealed no register. By now the sky was decidedly gray, with many disturbing lenticular like features. The descent off Bullon was a little scary-most of us chose to back down facing in for 500'. The 1200' regain to our camp was a brutal way to end a day on which one had just climbed a peak. We had just enough room to pitch the 2 tents. Sunset showed clear sky far to the east and the Olympics, so I still had hopes for just a cloudy day for Mon, but pitter patter on the tent in the wee hours of morning became steady light rain by daybreak. The nearby prominent summits were walkups and close, but the consensus was to leave them for a better day. I was home by noon, feeling stangely out of place. We had visited a fabulous little area.

Pollinger\nNearest major airport: Calgary, Alberta\ndescription: This is a 4200’+/- ascent day. Mount Whymper has to be one of the most accessible scrambles in Alan Kane’s Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies guide book. You start gaining elevation from the Kootenay Parkway (Highway 93). I did Mount Whymper in 4.5 hours round trip. Alan suggests 6-8 hours which is no doubt more in line. I did do a variation from the book and descended differently than I ascended making for a nice traverse. Park at the Stanley Glacier parking lot on Highway 93. Mount Whymper is directly across from Stanley Peak and bestows fantastic views of its north glacier/face routes on your entire ascent. Hike back east on the highway for approximately half a kilometer aiming for a broad avalanche gully flanking Mount Whymper to the east. A serious fire in Kootenay several years ago has laid waste to most of Mount Whymper’s eastern tree line. There are no trails to follow on ascent, but the going is fast and easy on the left side of the drainage bank. Route Description After a fast 2000’ ascent, you reach easy water worn rock. Follow the left drainage up a few steps of scrambling and continue up the drainage as it sucks you back left some more and the rock becomes less firm and more rubble. Another 1000’ of ascent puts you right below a large cirque full of rock bands and snow (early June). This is where I varied from the standard scramble route due to steep rotten snow slopes and opted instead to climb some large quartzite blocks on the left side of the cirque. I gained the left hand ridge (which continues to circumvent Mount Whymper) and maneveauvered through a few short sections of snow to the base of these massive blocks. I climbed the first set via some 5th class climbing through the middle and then traversed to my right to break through the steeper higher blocks on easier ground, albeit still 5th class. Once on top of these rock band obstacles, I ascended snow to the summit ridge, but was faced with significant overhanging cornices to break through. If you traverse right under these cornices (if the sun is out, you are taking a risk), it is easier to chop through a less severely angled portion. Once through the cornice and onto the ridge, it is a pleasant hike to the summit cairn. There was a summit register in 2006. I was the first to sign the register in 2006 (June), the last sign in coming in August, 2005. I chose to descend via the south ridge to a col between Mount Whymper and an unnamed peak. From this col, I glissaded down snow for approximately 1000’. You come to an area full of avalanche debris and the start of a running drainage atop the tree line. I stayed in the burnt forest to the left of the drainage for another 1000’ before moving along side it to avoid the deadfall. The drainage is not easy going, I recommend staying in the trees. The deadfall is not overwhelming due to the fire. You must angle left to reach the Stanley Glacier parking area.

We started at 7:00. The Twisp River was in a torrential state so we looked for a log crossing and came across one that was about .25 miles downstream from the campground and went across. This log crossing will be available for many years unless of course there is some major flooding in the area. The logjam is located directly beneath a pullout section of the road about .2 miles from the Road’s End campground. We then went cross-country and up to the right to find the abandoned mining road that Beckey talked about. We found it. However, I would recommend crossing the river and then walking directly back upstream to find the abandoned road. The abandoned mining road starts directly across the river from the Road’s End campground. This mining road is actually in pretty good shape and is even better than some trails in our state. Yes it has blowdowns but it is much better to stay on this road than to go cross-country. The abandoned road will wind its way to the old “Crescent Mine” on the USGS map. When you immediately cross the Crescent Lake stream on the abandoned road go directly uphill. Go uphill and veer to your left, because your objective is to be above the old mine site due to waterfalls but below some cliff bands. You want to be at about 5000 feet before you come to the next major stream shown on the USGS. This stream is to the SE of the Crescent Lake stream. Follow this drainage all the way to the col at 7400 feet. We had snow all the way. We put on crampons, but it was an iffy call if you needed them or not. We scrambled to the summit of Crescent Mountain. Summit time: 10:00 We scrambled down Crescent mountain on the west ridge and went over to South Creek Butte. We encountered no problems traversing. We reached South Creek Butte at 11:30. This Butte has melted glass everywhere and wires from an abandoned lookout. We went up point 7680+ to look at what we were accomplishing. We then went down the west ridge of 7680+ to the col and dropped our packs. We scrambled up to the summit of Mother Lode. Summit time: 1:00. We then went down to our packs because we were going to go down this couloir to Crescent Lake. We set up a snow bollard and did a 20-foot hanging rappel over snow down into this couloir. We then downclimbed the couloir another 200 feet. We then followed the snow filled Crescent Lake stream all the way down to the abandoned road.

This log crossing will be available for many years unless of course there is some major flooding in the area. The logjam is located directly beneath a pullout section of the road about .2 miles from the Roads End campground. We then went cross-country and up to the right to find the abandoned mining road that Beckey talked about. We found it. However, I would recommend crossing the river and then walking directly back upstream to find the abandoned road. The abandoned mining road starts directly across the river from the Roads End campground. This mining road is actually in pretty good shape and is even better than some trails in our state. Yes it has blowdowns but it is much better to stay on this road than to go cross-country. The abandoned road will wind its way to the old Crescent Mine on the USGS map. When you immediately cross the Crescent Lake stream on the abandoned road go directly uphill. Go uphill and veer to your left, because your objective is to be above the old mine site due to waterfalls but below some cliff bands. You want to be at about 5000 feet before you come to the next major stream shown on the USGS. This stream is to the SE of the Crescent Lake stream. Follow this drainage all the way to the col at 7400 feet. We had snow all the way. We put on crampons, but it was an iffy call if you needed them or not. We scrambled to the summit of Crescent Mountain. Summit time: 10:00 We scrambled down Crescent mountain on the west ridge and went over to South Creek Butte. We encountered no problems traversing. We reached South Creek Butte at 11:30. This Butte has melted glass everywhere and wires from an abandoned lookout. We went up point 7680+ to look at what we were accomplishing. We then went down the west ridge of 7680+ to the col and dropped our packs. We scrambled up to the summit of Mother Lode. Summit time: 1:00. We then went down to our packs because we were going to go down this couloir to Crescent Lake. We set up a snow bollard and did a 20-foot hanging rappel over snow down into this couloir. We then downclimbed the couloir another 200 feet. We then followed the snow filled Crescent Lake stream all the way down to the abandoned road. We hiked the abandoned road all the way to where the road reaches the campground. Remember you cant cross the river, so we went downstream to the logjam and crossed back to the car.

The north side of the mountain is in Switzerland and the south side is in Italy. The relief is much greater on the north than on the south. Views of the north side of the peak are striking from any angle. The long North Ridge is has been described as one of the best rock climbs of its grade in the Alps (UIAA III & IV with two places of IV+). The Northeast Face is a famous and much sought after climb with a rich history. Routes on the south side of the peak are not as long, but are of high quality and in a spectacular alpine environment. Because of its relatively modest elevation and the "pure rock" nature of its routes, many people underestimate the potential for, and the effects of severe weather on Badile. Many fatalities have resulted. One should read the account of the first ascent of the Northeast Face to be reminded. Seven different routes on Pizzo Badile are included in "Bernina / Bergell Die 100 Schoensten Touren" ( Bernina / Bergell the 100 Finest Routes ) by Giuseppe Miotti and Alessandro Gogna with Gaston Rebuffat.\nBest months for climbing: Jul, Aug\nConvenient Center: Promontogno, CH or San Martino, Italy\n	\N	Technical Climb	3308	Pizzo Badile	Switzerland/Italy	\N	\N	1

It is often incorrectly cited as the highest peak in the Kunlun Shan, due to a survey from the 1890's which gave it a height of 7720 meters. The current value for the height is from a careful modern survey done by the Sino-American first ascent expedition in 1985, and should be accurate to within 10 meters. (See the American Alpine Journal, 1986.)

You leave the Everest Base Camp Trek at Dingboche and walk up to Chhukung. Then a base camp and/or an advanced base camp can be established between 5300 and 5600 m. The route to the summit includes a rather steep slope and a narrow ridge. Crampons, Ice-axe and ropes are necessary. The name Island Peak was given to the mountain in 1952 by Eric Shipton's party who were on their way to explore the Barun Gorge. Seen from above Dingboche the mountain does indeed resemble an island in a sea of ice. In 1983 it was renamed Imja Tse, although for most people the descriptive name of Island Peak seems to have been retained. The mountain was first climbed in 1953 by a very prestigious team in preparation for the ascent of Everest. They were Charles Evans, Alf Gregory, Charles Wylie and Tenzing Norgay, with seven Sherpas who were trying out the new fangled oxygen sets; as practice, of course, for loftier things. Fortunately this didn't set a precedent and most people seem able to climb it without bottled air, although a Sherpa Seen from the moraines between Pheriche and Dingboche the mountain doesn't look too impressive, dwarfed as it is by one of the largest mountain faces in the world; the South Face of Lhotse. However, on close inspection it reveals itself to be an interesting and attractive summit with a highly glaciated West Face rising from the Lhotse Glacier. The mountain itself is really an extension of the South Ridge of Lhotse Shar and is separated from it by a small col. Above this gap, rising to the south, is a classically beautiful ridge leading to the summit of lmja Tse. The continuation of this ridge, descending south-west, provides part of the normal route of ascent and leads in turn to the South Summit, seen capping the rocky west facet of the mountain when viewed from near Chhukhung. As well as providing an enjoyable climb the peak also provides some of the most striking scenery in the Khumbu. If the peak can be likened to an island in a glacial sea, then the mainland forms a semicircle of cliffs that rise in the north to the rugged summits of Nuptse (7.879m) Lhotse (8.501m), Lhotse Middle Peak (8.410m), as yet still unclimbed andLhotse Shar (8.383m). To the east, rising above the frozen waves of the Lhotse SharGlacier, is Cho Polu (6.734m). beyond which can be seen the red granite mass ofMakalu (8,475m).\nBest months for climbing: Apr, May, Oct, Nov\nConvenient Center: Namche bazar\n	\N	Basic Snow/Ice Climb	6183	Imja Tse (Island Peak)	Nepal	\N	Central Nepal Himalaya	1

The North Face is Class 2+, but requires a climb up a steep scree gully. The West Ridge is Class 3 with a little more exposure, but the rock is more solid. The approach up the valley provides excellent views of Blanca Peak and Ellingwood Point\nBest months for climbing: Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Gardner\n	\N	Scramble	4280	Mount Lindsey	United States	Colorado	Sangre de Cristo Range	1

It was first climbed by an Anglo-American expedition in 1979. A number of other routes exist on the mountain which have been completed. The NE buttress (British attempts and Norwegian success), a few routes on the North Face (many attempts, Hungarian, New Zealand and Russian successes), and the South Face (British-American).

Kananaskis encompasses over 4,000 square kilometers of foothills and mountains bordering Banff National Park in the central Canadian Rockies. Mount Rae was officially named in 1859 after Dr. John Rae who conducted major expeditions into the uncharted Canadian Artic and became the first European to survive an Arctic winter living solely off the land. His greatest accomplishment was establishing the final link (Rae Strait) in the long search for the Northwest Passage. Mount Rae serves as the head of the main watershed to Calgary, Alberta by way of the Rae Glacier flowing into Elbow Lake, source of the Elbow River. At 10,558’, Rae is the highest mountain viewed on the front range from Calgary. In my opinion, this Highwood Pass area serves up the most scenic and accessible high alpine foliage in all of the Canadian Rockies. The only published route to the summit of Mount Rae that I am aware of is the moderate scramble. Although there are no published alpine ski routes to the summit, skiing the Rae Glacier is a winter objective in Kananaskis. The summit affords good views of the prairies to the east and the larger Kananaskis peaks to the west. This was a smoke filled hazy day, my photos are a disaster. Hopefully somebody will add some from a better day. Getting There Take the Kananaskis Trail (Highway 40) exit off of the Trans-Canada Highway between Calgary and Canmore. Drive to the Highwood Pass day parking area at 7239’ (Highwood Pass Interpretive Trail). Kananaskis Trail is closed from December 1 through June 15, and I do mean with a gate. The closure is at Kings Creek (Canyon), meaning no access to any of the Highwood area mountains prior to June 15th. (except by ski) Red Tape There are no permit requirements to enter, climb and/or park in Kananaskis Provincial Park. This is active grizzly country however. Take bear spray. You drive by the park headquarters on the way in on Highway 40. Any recent notices will be posted on the bulletin board outside. If they are open, check in with the ranger staff, they have tons of beta and are always friendly. When To Climb As with most climbs in the Canadian Rockies, the driest time is from June through September. I climbed Mount Rae in August and the route was free of snow on ascent. There are no published backcountry ski routes on Mount Rae, but the mountain is open to skiing on the Rae Glacier. Camping The closest camping is a backcountry site at Elbow Lake, 1.3 km in on Big Elbow Trail back north a few kilometers off of Hwy 40. There are tons of camping options further north at Kananaskis Lakes. You cannot camp outside of the marked specific camping areas in Kananaskis. Refer to the Kananaskis Provincial Park website for more information regarding camping and/or lodging. Mountain Conditions The Kananaskis Provincial Park website is a very thorough park website, including trail conditions or closures, wildlife notices, weather conditions, avalanche conditions, camping permits, whitewater conditions, etc. It is an excellent source if you are going to spend any time here and comparable to any National Park website I have used. Outside of the parks web site, Canadian Avalanche Association is also useful, particularly for winter travel.\nConvenient Center: Canmore, Alberta\n	Alberta	Scramble	3218	Mount Rae	Canada	\N	Canadian Rockies	1

The easiest is III+. From some perspective the Trettachspitze almost looks as impressive as the Matterhorn why it is often refererd to as the "Allgäuer Matterhorn". The mountain is composed of quite good limestone (Hauptdolomit). Together with the Hochfrottspitze and the Mädelegabel the Trettachspitze forms the "Allgäuer Dreigestirn" which is visible from Einödsbach. I climbed this peak in 1998 with my pals Marco Klocker and Siegfried Gugele. Siegfried had an accident when going down a frozen snowfield. He crashed into a stone and gravel field after sliding down about 25 meters on the snowfield. He suffered some not too severe injuries and was lucky to have survived.

The centerpiece Okuhotakadake rises to 3190 m making it Japan's third tallest mountain. Okuhotakadake is surrounded by four additional peaks. Nishihotakadake to the southwest is the shortest at 2909 m, Maehotakadake to the southeast is next at 3090 m followed by Karasawadake (3110 m) and Kitahotakadake (3106 m) to the north. Routes to Okuhotakadake require some scrambling at the higher elevations along exposed ridges that drop off steeply several hundreds of meters in places. Because of easy access, Hotakadake receives significant traffic annually. The combination of heavy traffic and potentially hazardous routes, especially in inclement weather, has resulted in a number of fatalities over the years, making Hotakadake one of the deadliest mountains in all of Japan.

The most recent eruption was on the northwest flank in 1909. There is still volcanic activity on top of the mountain, like the overwhelming smell of sulfur dioxide and other gasses. The volcano dominates the whole panorama of Tenerife and the neighboring islands. The summit is easy accessible by cable car. For safety reasons the footpath up to the summit is sometimes closed. Additional Information below provided by J. Vranjes: El Teide (3718 m) is the highest Spanish mountain, located on Tenerife, one of Canarian Islands. The mountain is a dormant volcano and a national park, so going to the summit requires a permit that is free of charge and can be obtained through the Internet as well (see the link below for details). El Teide can be conveniently approached from the north, from Puerto de la Cruz. It is a 40 kilometers drive up through a beautiful pine forests and then over a large flat plateau (volcanic crater) at an altitude of about 2000-2200 m. The car parking from which the route starts is at around 2350 m. Also available is a regular bus transportation from Puerto de la Cruz to hotel Parador. The lower part of the route is a pleasant wide road through a volcanic landscape, for about 90 minutes till the altitude of 2720 m. After that it is a much steeper foot path zigzagging towards the refuge Altavista at 3260 m. After the refuge the route goes through large lava rocks, yet the path is well maintained and unproblematic. At around 3540 m the route splits into two, the one going to the right is the old route which is oficially closed, while the left one goes towards 'teleferico' (lift), passing the ranger post where the permits are checked, and then to the summit. Gear: good walking shoes. Accommodation: hotel Parador at around 2200 m, refuge Altavista.\nBest months for climbing: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec\nMost recent eruption: 1909\nConvenient Center: Playa de las Americas\n	\N	Walk up	3718	Teide	Spain	\N	Canary Islands	1

Acclimatization of a week or so is required in Arequipa (2400m), or higher, in places nearby such as the Colca Canyon, Cusco, or Lake Titicaca (3000-3800m). It is possible to hire guides, equipment, and 4x4s in Arequipa, for around 60-70 US dollars pp, everything apart from food included. One can drive to around 4700m and then camp at 5200m up an obvious trail. Six or more hours are required to get to the summit from this camp and crampons and ice axes are certainly required, the ice being quite difficult to negotiate especially on the long 600m ascent of Fatima (5900m) , a precursor of the summit proper. The summit itself stands at 6057m and superb views of El Misti, slightly below 6000m, and other volcanoes in towards the Colca Canyon, are likely in the dry, arid region of Peru.

The Norwegian name of the mountain can be translated with "Snow-Hat". This will probably describe the shape of the peak among the year. And to say the truth on the summit there is mostly snow. The trip to the summit (elevation 2,286 m/7,500 ft) is more or less very easy to reach. Thus it is also possible to plan a whole family trip up to the top. But certainly this depends on the season and the weather conditions. Remember that on wintertime the trip might be much more difficulty than on summertime, because af the coldness and strong wind. How to come there? The mountain is located in the Dovrefjell-Nationalpark in Norway. From Kongsvoll Railwaystation (beside the European Street E6) one follows the path to Reinheim (cabin owns by the Norwegian Tourist Club). It takes some hours of walking from Konsvoll to Reinheim and therefore it is recommended to stay there and try the summit on the next day. The cabin is a good place to start up to the summit. The "way" up is marked in summer as well as in winter. So if one needs something different try the Snøhetta and maybe one can also see musks.

It is the highest peak and only fourteener in the Ten Mile Range. It is just South of Breckenridge. The most popular and easiest route up is via its long and gentle East ridge. This peak is also a great winter climb and ski descent, due to its excellent access and gentle slopes. Additional text submitted by Ted Eliason The South 'Cristo' Couloir is a consistent 45 degree slope from base to summit. It can be climbed in roughly 2 to 5 hours depending on pace (I took me 4 hours, the fastest climbers on the mountain 5/27 completed the climb in two hours right behind me). The couloir itself is fairly sheltered from the wind and makes for good cramponing. The pitch is too steep to rely on skis with skins alone. There was snow cover from the summit to the base on 5/20/00. By 5/27/00 a large rock band was exposed in the slope near the summit, preventing a ski decent starting from the summit. Sunhit in the couloir was around 7:30 am, with snow conditions becoming optimal for skiing around 10:30-11:00 am. Climbers on the summit that took the East ridge claimed the slope was gradual enought that crampons were not required, even though there remained some snow cover.\nBest months for climbing: Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Breckenridge\n	\N	Walk up	4348	Quandary Peak	United States	Colorado	Central Colorado Ranges	1

Because of its situation, it provides very nice views of the whole Chiemsee (Chiem lake) and the surrounding Northern limestone Alps(Kaiser, Berchtesgaden Alps, Leoganger and Loferer Mountains) and even far into the central Alps (Groþglockner). The chain has several summits. The easiest and most visited summit with the bif summit cross is the eastern summit. It is accessible for hiker (short parts are secured with cables). The Kampenwand is also one of the most important center of rock climbing in the Bavarian prealps. Especially, it's south walls offer a host of well protected rock climbs on solid limestone slabs. The difficulty range from III - VIII (on the UIAA rating system). The traverse of the whole ridge from the West to the main summit, passing some towers, is a famous climb for apprentice rock climbers (stretches III-IV, but mostly I-II). The south wall climbs can be done virtually the whole year, as long as the access via the South wall trail is possibly which is usually the case except in years with excessive snow fall like winter 1998/99.

Cima di Jazzi is more modest in hight, and from the Swiss side not very impressive. Here it is part of a huge flattened ice-ridge, of which comes the second largest glacier in the Alps, the Gornerglacier. It is easily accessible, and that is why un experienced climbers are no rare visitors of this mountains. You can get in a lot of trouble because the visibility is the worst in the entire Alps. The reason why is the huge temperature difference between Monterosa(4634m) and the nearby Po-valley( below 200m in height), which causes a lot of clouds; if you have not much experience, please hire a guide in Staffa/Macugnaga. The most common way to reach the summit is from the Italian side. When you reach the end of the Belvedere-glacier, there is a path over the Alpe Roffel, and then over the Jazzi-glacier at approximately 2800m to the E.Sella Cabin (3029); less than a km from the Swiss border. Then over the Roffel-glacier( steeper) to a pass: Neues Weisstor 3490m, on the border. Then the summit can be reached in about an hour (Ice /snow only.

The southern-most peak (11,877 ft.) is mistaken on many maps as the highest. The true summit is the northern-most peak. It is most commonly accessed by means of a trail which begins along the Nebo Loop Road. It can also be climbed by way of the Andrew's Ridge route, beginning at the trailhead in Nephi's Salt Creek Canyon. The established trails end at the south summit, and ridge scrambling and exposure are required to reach the north summit. An alternate route is the north ridge. Beginning on the Nebo Loop Road, bushwhack to Wolf Pass, then proceed up the ridge to the north summit. Another popular route is the Willow Creek trail, which begins east of Nephi. WARNING: Do NOT attempt the north summit or go past the south summit in bad weather. A FALL ON THE SUMMIT RIDGE CAN BE FATAL. Whiteouts during a storm can completely conceal the route.

(For more information on the Karakoram generally, see Peakware's entry for "Gasherbrum". The balance of this entry for G IV has been written by its peak guardian.) It should be acknowledged that, after Bonnatti and Mauri's First Ascent by way of the NE Ridge in 1958, supra, one of the most spectacular ascents was that made on June 22, 1986 of the daunting NW Ridge, which traversed G IV's North Summit, just 40 ft lower, but 700 ft East, of the true summit, by an Australian/American team, consisting of T. Macartney-Snape, T. Hargis, and Greg Child (see "Thin Air," by Greg Child; Gibbs Smith: 1988). G IV is certainly one of the most symmetrical and stunning mountains of the Karakoram, which is known for is jagged, irregularly angled peaks. It is important to recognize that, while G IV is the "lowest" of the first four named G Mountains, it is but ONE of many mountains and peaks in the sprawling G Group or Massif, which extends in a counter-clockwise arc, which may be said to originate at G I ("Hidden Peak"), and which nearly encircles the South G Glacier, ending with G VI, and this not even including the numerous peaks and sub-peaks radiating throughout this complex, intricate Group. Indeed, according to Peakware's own list of highest unclimbed mountains, G IV itself has an unclimbed (believed as of 2006) sub-peak, i.e., G IV (South), appx. 7100 metres [m] (all altitudes herein are presented in metres) at a Longitude of 35.4.35 N, and Latitude of 76.37.02 E. Also, G IV itself has been the subject of various estimated heights, including 7932, which several respectable authorities (including ALPEX Peaklist's, list of "Highest Mountains in Pakistan"; and as quoted in Answers.com; Top 100 www.mt.everest [in translation from the original German]) all still cite as the correct height. Likewise, Wikipedia lists G IV at 7925 in its individual entry for that mountain, but inconsistently also lists G IV as 7932 in its list of highest mountains. The other main mountains of the G Group are well-known, i.e., G I, 8068; G II, 8035; G III, 7952 (also est. at 7980 & 7946); G V, 7147 (also est. at 7321, though now largely disregarded); and G VI, 7003. Some of the significant, regularly quoted sub-peaks (listed herein in descending order of altitude) are, inter alia: G I [SouthEast], 7817; G III [West], 7810; G II [East], 7772 (also est. at 7588); G II [NorthWest] 2, 7702; G II [NW] 1, 7591; G II [NW] 4, 7476; G II [NW] 5, 7430; G II [NW] 3, 7328; G II [NW] 6, 7300; also believed unclimbed as of 2006 is G V [Central], 7120. Most curious is the fact that the Lat. and Long. of G IV itself is quoted differently by different, respectable sources, incl. quotes -- cited here using the traditional degree system -- of: 35.46, 76.37 (Peakbagger.com 2006); 35.44, 76.35 (Wikipedia's entry for G IV 2006); 35.45.45, 76.37.00 (Jurgalski and de Ferranti 2006); and, 35.73330, 76.58330 (decimal system)(summitpost.org 2006); NOTE: the quoted Lat. and Long. in the info box, supra, is the decimal translation of 35.45.33, 76.36.57, quoted in Wikipedia's "List of highest mountains," and as quoted in Answers.com 2006. In any event, the reader should well appreciate that G IV, though the "lowest" of the four, first named G Mountains, is by no means the last of the G Mountains, nor of their recognized sub-peaks, depending upon one's definition of a separate mountain, e.g., by prominence to the nearest other "mountain" -- a subject that is far beyond the scope of this entry. It is sufficient to recognize that the various sub-peaks of the G Group are indeed regularly cited as significant enough to be counted in many if not most lists of the "top 100" or so highest peaks of the world. Like many Karakoram peaks, they are what one might characterize as sharp, angular, glaciated, and what I (the peak guardian) describe as "angry"-looking mountains (even more so relative to many peaks of the Himalayan Range proper). Strictly speaking, the entire Karakoram is a Trans-Himalayan Range, relatively uninhabited compared with the Himalaya, and for a good reason. The Karakoram is relatively inhospitable compared with the Southern slopes of the Himalaya, which lie in the rain shadow of the Central Asian Monsoon, whereas the Karakoram Range is generally not affected by the Monsoon, and its life-giving rains. (That is also the reason why June through August is the best climbing season in the Karakoram, unlike the Himalaya, which is inundated by the Monsoon snows during these months.) The Karakoram, and the Baltoro subrange in which the G Group is situated, is exceedingly remote. G IV itself is arcane in its psychological and physical isolation, being at or over the 26,000 foot mark, but below the arbitrary, metric 8000 metre-mark, which is about 26,246 ft., and thus, like some other imposing independent mountains over 26,000 ft. but under 8000 metres, puts G IV just below the magical, metric 8000 metre-mark. In ths regard, it bears recognition that there are only TWO mountains in the G Group that reach over this 8000 metre-mark, i.e., G I (Hidden Peak) at 8068 m, and G II, at 8035m. Both G III and G IV fall just short of this arbitrary metric measurement. Surely, G III and G IV, especially G IV, rank as more difficult an ascent, by any route, than G II. Nonetheless, both G III and G IV, while over 26,000 ft., fall short of the 8000 metre-mark. It should be noted that Peakware's own entry for "Gasherbrum" itself, and for G II, incorrectly state or imply that there are THREE mountains in the G Group over 8000 metres. That is just not so, despite the fact that G III and G IV deserve to be considered in the same "class" as 8000 metre peaks, and if the English foot measurement system prevailed over the Continental metric system in the climbing world, would have to be included in the list of the class of giant peaks over 26,000 ft.\nBest months for climbing: Jun, Jul, Aug\nConvenient Center: Askole\n	\N	Major Mountain Expedition	7925	Gasherbrum IV	Pakistan/China	\N	Karakoram	1

E.\nNearest major airport: Seattle\ndescription: Mt. Constance is the highest and most massive peak on the eastern front of the Olympics. It is the fifth highest peak in the range after Mt. Deception and the three summits of Mt. Olympus. It is composed of basalt erupted beneath the Pacific Ocean 15 million years ago, and tipped upright to form vertical walls of knobby basketball-sized "pillows". Montane forest reaches up to 5000' and patches of sub-alpine character persist to 7000'. The mountain's higher reaches are alpine and host range endemic species such as Flett's Violet and Piper's Bellflower. The massif is bisected by a glacially carved canyon opening to the south and draining steeply to the Dosewallips River. A National Park road is etched across the lower buttresses of the mountain at 1500' elevation. A delightful trail rises 3200' in two miles from the road, following Constance Creek to Lake Constance at the mouth of Avalanche Canyon. From this point, a variety of mixed snow and rock routes (II,3 thru IV,5.7) access the summit and a dozen other satellite peaks. In 1857 Lt. George Davidson anchored his ship in a cove in the Puget Sound in southwest Seattle. At that time Lt. Davidson was engaged to Ellinor Fauntleroy and set out to impress his future father in law by naming prominent features after folks in the Fauntleroy family. Fauntleroy Cove was named after his future father-in-law, R. H. Fauntleroy. Davidson, impressed with the spectacular view of the Olympics to the west, named Mt. Ellinor, for his bride to be.

Fremont\nNearest major airport: Jackson, WY\ndescription: From the west, Fremont Peak appears as the highest peak in the Wind River Mountains (Gannett Peak is not visible from Pinedale, WY). During the 15 mile hike in, there are reoccurring views of Fremont Peak and the other high peaks of the north-central Wind River Mountains. In August, the Class 3 scramble route (southwest slope) is snow-free, with no significant exposure. Joe Kelsey's book, "Climbing and Hiking in the Wind River Mountains" is highly recommended for this and other climbs/backpack trips in the Wind River Mountains. Fremont Peak provides the non-technical "scrambler" the opportunity to ascend a high Rocky Mountain peak with superb views (Gannett Peak and Grand Teton in the distance). Additional text submitted by Keith McPheeters Rising to 13,745 feet on the Continental Divide, Fremont Peak is the third highest summit in Wyoming, falling just lower than Gannett Peak and The Grand Teton. Located approximately 17 miles from the nearest trailhead at Elkhart Park outside of Pinedale, Wyoming, Fremont Peak is a massive cornerstone of the Wind River Range that dominates the skyline for many miles. The easiest climbing routes constitute a ClassIV scramble of the prominent buttress of the Southwest Face best accessed from the Island Lake area via the Indian Lakes Basin. Technical climbing routes and difficult mixed ice and rock routes abound on the East Face overlooking the Fremont Glacier and the Northwest Face adjacent to Mount Sacajawea. Fremont Peak was named after Cpt. John Fremont who believed he had climbed Fremont Peak in 1842, however, subsequent expeditions positively determined Cpt. Fremont to have actually climbed nearby Mount Woodrow Wilson. Sitting in the center of the vast and remote Wind River Range, Fremont Peak represents a fine climbing challenge in arguably the most beautiful alpine environment in the United States.\nBest months for climbing: Aug\nConvenient Center: Pinedale, WY\n	\N	Scramble	4190	Fremont Peak	United States	Wyoming	Wind River Range	1

The hike is straightforward, except for a traverse under cathedral rock that demands attention. This campsitem on a grassy field, has good access to running water, and is a 15 minute walk from the the permanent snow fields. Another possible campsite, is up by the lower snowfields. The third possible camp, is about 20 minutes (without a pack) up rock and snow terraces. This put you right at the base of an enormous snow bowl. From any of these camps, you continue into the snow bowl. From ther you can continue up to the right, up a 45 degree gulley. After the gulley, you turn left and head up a snowslope with a nice runout up to the East Summit. From there you traverse down the South to a gap in the ridge, where you cross over the ridge, This is where the second route meets the first route. The second route bears left in the snowbowl, and continues up a gentle slope, not requiring ropes. From there, you traverse right until the notch in the ridge. From the ridge it is a short rocky traverse on an at times non-existent path. From there a short snow slope takes you to the final level ridge to the summit.

The glaciers change quite a bit from year to year, so there are several routes from which to choose from. The climb is steep and there are many hidden crevasses. At about 18,000ft there is about 100ft of 65 degree climbing and then a traverse to the left which requires a fixed line and then leads up to the summit plateau.

It is a dormant volcano rising 750m above the floor of the Rift Valley. The most popular excursions at the Park are walks up to and around the crater rim. You should count nearly a full day for this, and it is important to be in good physical condition to attempt this walk. For safety reasons (buffalos!) perhaps it's better to go with a ranger from Wildlife Service (obvious that he wants a tip for his service). The caldera is circular, over a kilometre in diameter, with steep-sides walls, and you can see some steam jets. Longonot is famous for some special species of birds and other animals. The name Longonot originates from the Masaai word Oloonong'ot, meaning "mountain of steep ridges". In fact, the entire perimeter of the extinct crater is characterized by deep ridges. First walking or by car 4 kms from the small Longonot village to the Park gate, from there you take the path up to Longonot. To reach the lip pf the crater rim, count 1 hr and a half from Park entrance. The path aorund the crater is easy to follow, but in some parts slippery and steep. You should count on a full day for this, and it is important to be in good physical condition to attempt this walk. Sometimes dangerous are the buffalos you can meet in the mre down part of the way. There is no lodging within the national park. The best is to find lodging in nearby Naivasha, approximately 20 kms north. The only camping facility at the park is the campground, located at the Park's entrance, with water and toilet facilities.\nBest months for climbing: Jan, Feb, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Naivasha\n	\N	Walk up	2777	Mount Longonot	Kenya	\N	\N	1

It is the highest peak of the Siachen glacier area, the largest glacier outside (sub)polar areas. In this area the government of India permits only one expedition per year. Only joint Indian expeditions are allowed. This combined with the fact that this is one of the most difficult high peaks can explain why it has not been climbed since the first ascent by Japan. The altitude is generally recognized as 7207 metres, or 23,645 feet, but also has been quoted at 7202m or 23,629ft. (Some quotes give the altitude as substantially different, i.e., as 7751m or 25,430ft.) The Siachen Glacier area is vigorously disputed by India and Pakistan.

This massif is spread in area between Serbia, Albania and Montenegro, on Balkan peninsula in the south of Europe. Actually, Djeravica (some people call it Djerovica) is the highest point in Yugoslavia. It is situated on the border between Yugoslavia and Republic of Albania. So, on one side there is Yugoslavia and the other side belongs to Albania. It means you can visit two countries. The height you will feel on that peak is exactly 2656 m, and it is not too hard to get it. You do not need to use some special climbing gear, except if you want to get top in winter condition. In summer, you need only good boots, and ordinary mountaineering equipment. For sure, recommendation is to go there in Jun, July and August. The first of all, if you want to ascend this top, is to reach the foot of the mountain. If you ask me, it is rather difficult then climbing. You must visit the small city which name is Visoki Decani. It is in the Kosovo, province of Yugoslavia. There you can get information about getting the Serbian monastery Decani. You cannot miss it. It is very old, famous Serbian church, built in middle century. From monastery the road is bad, but still you are able to reach the small electrical plant - Koznjar. There, you leave your vehicle and take backpack, and now you are ready to go straight into adventure. You will follow the river or stream, which depends on how much water is there. The river is called "Kosovska Bistrica". You need about two hours, and you will see a valley - Ropski pesak. I can freely claim- it is valley from dreams. In the center there is cold and clean river, the green grass and everything is surrounded by wood and mountaintops. You can pick your camp there, because you have everything you need. But if you are fit and have a good strength, than you could go further. The top, which we are interested in, is on the left, but it is too difficult to explain the way. You must have a map, especially because there is no marks. Also you won't see mountaineers at all. But if you posses good map there is no problem. Finally, I must warn you. Probably, you've heard about the war, which was in that area last year! So you must be careful because maybe, you could have some problems. Perhaps, some non-exploded bombs, mines and missiles could appear. It is small possibility about that, but the wonder is happened, isn't it? There are International forces - KFOR, which are trying to keep the peace. But honestly I don't know how much they can protect you nowadays. As always in mountaineering everything is on you. Of course, there is a peace now, but nobody can assure you about your safety.\nBest months for climbing: May, Jun, Jul, Aug\nConvenient Center: Visoki Decani or Pec\n	\N	Walk up	2656	Djeravica	Serbia and Montenegro	\N	Dinaric Alps	1

It is right on the border between Serbia and Bulgaria on the Balkan Peninsula. The peak reaches 2169-m height. It is great and famous Serbian peak. Generally, it is not some remarkable peak, but surely it is very interesting place. Ascending on Midzor is not difficult. Actually it is only hiking. But if there is bad weather, it can be very windy, and cold, so be careful about that. You can get solid accommodation in the mountain hut or house "Babin zub". Of course you need sleeping bag for hut. It is not easy finding the right way to Babin zub. The best way is to reach airport in Belgrade. Then you get regular bus line to Knjazevac, where you will sit into bus form small place Kalna. In Kalna you must hire some vehicle or you can hitchhike. Finally you will be in mountain house Babin zub. There is several ways to reach Midzor, and I described one of them. You can use train or rent-a-car, but one is sure, you must posses good map, because people in that area very little speak English or some foreign language. By the way, nowadays, a big hotel is built near the mountain house. When will it be finished I really don't know, but it'll be very luxuries hotel. If you ask about ascending, answer is when you will be there you will see everybody can climb the top in good weather conditions. There are no marks and there is no need for that.

Kephart is but another bump on an undulating ridgeline. It is well known, however, as the site of the famous Jump-off, a sheer face visible from Charlie's Bunion and the AT. Mt. Kephart was named for Horace Sauers Kephart, author of OUR SOUTHERN HIGHLANDERS, CAMPING AND WOODCRAFT, and innumerable magazine articles. Kep, as he was called by his friends, was also an early conservationist and-- along with Col. Davis Chapman-- one of the founding fathers of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He and Chapman were first people ever honored by the USGS with official placenames bestowed during their lifetimes; the naming of Mt. Kephart, however, caused some furor on the Tennessee side of the Smokies-- a brouhaha which is barely remembered today, but which was something to behold back in the early 1930s. For further information on the nomenclature controversy or on Horace Kephart's life, contact me.

It is a difficult scramble and when combined with a summit traverse of Mount Niblock, the route makes for a long day in the mountains. Its summit can also be accessed via an alpine climb of its east ridge, the Perren Route (Alpine II 5.6). Its summit view gives way to the significant Victoria and Lefroy glaciers as well as the surrounding Lake Louise mountains. Mount Whyte is a more technical and exposed undertaking than Mount Niblock. The vantage point is well worth the effort however. The route finding on the scramble route is challenging and many take rock gear to make the ascent as well as some rappel stations are in place. Of course the rock is marginal which is typical of the location. For those less inclined for such an adventure among your group, send them to Mt. St. Piran, Mt. Fairview and/or Mt. Sheol as parking will be the same for these Lake Louise objectives. Mount Whyte was officially named in 1898 after a Canadian Pacific Railway executive and was first ascended by Edward Whymper in 1901 along with three guides, Kaufmann, Klucker and Pollinger. Getting There The Trans-Canada dissects Banff National Park east to west as you come in from Calgary. Travel to the Lake Louise exit and turn left through town and follow this road 5 km to its end at the Lake Louise parking area. Red Tape You will be required to purchase a national park pass as you enter the park. This pass is good for all four national parks. If you plan many visits to Canadian National Parks within one year, you should purchase an annual pass. There are no permit requirements to climb in Banff National Park, but all camping is regulated. There is also a backcountry permit required if you plan on spending a night in the backcountry versus the town campsites. This can be obtained via the parks website which is included in the camping section below. Park headquarters are located in Banff and you will drive through the manned kiosks as you enter the park. This is active grizzly country, therefore, you should always have bear spray on your person. We just had a grizzly fatality in Canmore, June, 2005. This approach trail is rarely restricted as it leads to the Lake Agnes Tea House. However, I advise checking with Parks Canada for any area and/or trail closures. When To Climb As with most scrambles in the Canadian Rockies, the driest time is from June through September. I climbed Mount Niblock and Mount Whyte in August via the traverse and the route was in condition. There are no published backcountry ski routes on these mountains, nor would it be conducive to ski to the summits. Camping The closest camp site would be back in town at the Lake Louise Campground. You can go on line at Banff National Park to pick a camp site and obtain your camping permit. You will also be required to obtain your backcountry permit which is separate, but can be obtained simultaneously if you plan on camping at a backcountry site. The Lake Louise Alpine Center Hostel is a great place to eat and has been recently renovated, but is more expensive than your average hostel. Of course those with the big bucks can camp out at the Chateau itself. Mountain Conditions Banff National Park’s website has weather, wildlife reports, trail closures, etc. Outside of the parks web site, Canadian Avalanche Association is also useful, particularly for winter travel.\nBest months for climbing: Jul, Aug\nConvenient Center: Lake Louise, AB\n	Alberta	Scramble	2976	Mount Niblock	Canada	\N	Canadian Rockies	1

Although nobody is certain about the origin naked mountaintops (aboriginal practice of fire ecology, ice damage, invasion by gall wasps, and grazing pressure by bison and/or by Anglo livestock have all been theorized as potential points of genisis), we are all thankful for their presence in our densely forested hills (Southern Appalachia has no zonally occuring timberline). Max Patch, which is maintained in a grassy state by of periodic mechanical mowing, is readily acessible via dirt road (NC 1182) and by the Appalachian Trail. The view from the summit-- which is gained by one of those much-steeper-than-it-looks-from-the-trailhead type hikes-- is superb: at arm's length, the grassy earth falls away with 360 degree views just beyond; it seems a short stride would plummet you to the floor of the Tennessee Valley, onto the backbone of Bluff Mtn, or atop the steppingstone crest of Mt. Sterling. Roan Mtn and Mt Mitchell are also visible in the ultimate distance.

Before His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso left Tibet in 1959 it was a traditional ceremony, that every year the Dalai Lama, riding a horse, went up to the summit in a grand procession of pilgrims to make a sacrificial offering to Buddha. Lots of "Mani"-stones and prayer-flags on the summit still show the religious importance of this mountain. From the summit you have a great view down to Lhasa and over the wide valley of the Kyi Chhu or Lhasa-river. To climb Gompe Utse on the pilgrims-trail go to Drebung by bus or taxi and pass the monastery on the left side (In Tibet sacred places like monasterys, "Mani"-stones and other praying-places always should be passed clockwise!). North of the monastery the steep trail leads up a broad and rocky crest and then goes right (east) to the small hermitage "Gephel Rithr?" (4480m), which you already can see from Drebung. From here go up north on steep slopes until you reach the east-ridge at about 4940m. Then follow the pilgrims-trail marked with stone-mans, that leads you to the summit. It is also possible to climb Gompe Utse on the east-ridge, directly from Lhasa. From the Potala-palace go north to the location "Baerku" at the southeast-base of the long east-ridge. Then go up without any trail to the small peak "D¸nla Baerku Tse" (4218m), where you have a great view over Lhasa. Now always follow shepherds-trails near the ridge. First you pass two more small peaks, then the ridge ascends, until you reach a shoulder at 4940m, where the pilgrims-trail comes up from Drebung, and follow this trail to the summit.\nBest months for climbing: Apr, May, Jun, Sep, Oct\nConvenient Center: Lhasa (3658m)\n	\N	\N	5240	Gompe Utse	China	\N	Central Tibetan Plateau	1

The peak itself (that, along the nearby and much less frequented Levanna Centrale and Occidentale, forms the Levanna Group) is topped by a long, almost flat ridge, dividing a French side - a 250 mts high steep wall, mostly ice and rock, and a much higher Italian side, going down to the valley floor for almost 2300 mts. Actually, to geto on the top of the Levanna, you've to climb on of the biggest mandatory height gain of the entire Alps. The normal route is thus quite long, requiring normally one night in the nice Daviso Hut (2.30 hrs. from Forno Alpi Graie). From there, is still 6/7 hours to the top, first on scree and loose rock, then on a sistem of nevees and short rock steps, not really difficult but interesting - and requiring some care. Overall, it is a remote spot where is preferable not getting caught by bad weather and/or fog. A more technical alternative is combining the approach from the northern Orco Valley (the southernmost side of the Gran Paradiso massif, renowend for several fine and difficult climbs of granite) with the short French wall. The refuge of choice is the Leonesi hut (a true eagle's nest) located at 2900 mts. and reachable from Ceresole in 4 hrs. From there, you climb the steep (40-50 dgs.) couloir up the Colle Perduto, then, after a short traverse on the glacier on the opposite side, you climb the western wall, a mini north face of Tour Ronde of sort. In winter, it is a delightful and interesting climb in almost complete isolation. From the top the view is nothing short of breathtaking - from the southern Marittime Alps up to the Monte Rosa Massif, and west all the Vanoise-Ecrin area. The other two Levannas are much less frequented (it means that are almost deserted!). Occidentale is the least interesting. Centrale is the highest (3607 mts.) and none of its route are easy. The most interesting are from the Ceresole/Orco side, and requires some long climbing/scrambling on steep rock, becoming much more difficult under wet or icy conditions.\nBest months for climbing: Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Groscavallo\n	\N	Basic Snow/Ice Climb	3555	Levanna Orientale	Italy/France	\N	Graian Alps	1

This range of hills which run south from Great Malvern for about 9 miles were, in Elgar's(Local Composer) day, as now, perfect for miles of safe walking. They consist of a chain of hills with such names as Hollybush Hill, Swinyard Hill, Hangman's Hill and Midsummer Hill.

It is located within Parque Nacional Los Glaciares (Argentina) just north of Torres del Paine National Park (Chile). It is the tallest of four peaks rising along the easern edge of the the Patagonian Ice Cap (the others are Torre Egger, Punta Herron, and Cerro Standhart). Cerro Torre is one of the world's most coveted peaks because of its technical difficulty and notoriously bad weather, and many climbers have turned back just shy of the summit, which is often covered in a mushroom of rime ice. Cesare Maestri reported that he and Toni Egger had been the first to summit the peak in 1959, a climb in which Egger was killed in an avalanche during the descent. However, Maestri's claim has come under much dispute. Maestri tried again in 1970 with a new team of climbers, this time equipped with a gas-powered compressor drill and enough bolts to construct a route up 350 meters of rock. Despite his determination and technology, however, he still was unable to ascend the ice mushroom at the top. The first undisputed ascent was made by Daniele Chiappa, Mario Conti, Casimiro Ferrari, and Pino Negri in 1974.\nBest months for climbing: Jan, Nov, Dec\n	\N	Major Mountain Expedition	3133	Cerro Torre	Argentina	\N	Patagonia	1

Although it is not a particularly big or tall mountain even by Appalachian standards, it is still quite an impressive peak worthy of welcoming and guiding thousands every day into the higher country. The Pilot is awkward in appearance with a large rocky pinnacle and a smaller outcropping interrupting what would otherwise be an ordinary and boring forested mound. The main pinnacle abruptly rises nearly 200 ft. straight up on all sides and then once again assumes a gentle vegetatated upwards slant before maxing out at the true summit. Because of this imposing cylinder shaped cropping as well as climbing restrictions, few reach the top these days (with exception to the beautiful birds of prey who nest on the "crown"). Once upon a time, there was a system of ladders, but perhaps due to the lack of safety, they've long since been removed. One can still enjoy the mountain with a 2.5 mile trail that loops around Big Pinnacle and Little Pinnacle. The views are grand. Climbing on the summit knob of Pilot Mountain is prohibited because it is an occasional nesting ground of the rare Northern Raven. Despite this, there are some fun rock climbing routes on crags near the summit knob, and the park authorities and the local climbing authorities are on good terms. Obviously, for this state of affairs to continue, it is absolutely essential that climbers do not climb on the summit knob.\nConvenient Center: Mount Airy\n	\N	Technical Climb	759	Pilot Mountain	United States	North Carolina	Blue Ridge Mountains	1

Fujiyama in Japan. Usual route is from the south, starting in juntas. Hiking starts at ~2,650 meters above sea level, so it is a pretty long hike to the top, requiring something like 9-12 hours in total. Halfway there is a cave where people can set up camp. Snowline starts at ~4,900-5,000 meters. Loose rocks are frequent above the snowline. View from the top is magnificent. The height is usually published as 5215 mts but this may be inaccurate. Some maps published during WW2 "lowered" many Andes peaks for strategic purposes. Little is known (in Colombia) of the first ascent (1928). The second (in 1942) was by a Colombian team which included the seismologist/vulcanologist Padre Jesus Emilio Ramirez (later Rector of the Universidad de los Andes in Bogota). He described the ascent as passing round many active fumerols and, upon arriving at the top, he was met with the vista of an almost flat (slightly sloping) rectangular area about the size of the Plaza de Bolivar in Bogota with no sign of a crater. When I climbed it in 1966 I was on the lookout for the fumerols but saw none. Coming to the top of the glacier, I saw the high point and began to set off in that direction. To my amazement, I was starting to look down into an enormouse crater with steam rising from it. Somewhat fearful (being on my own at this stage), I retreated to the rim and, skirting the crater, shortly arrived at the high point (northeast corner if memory serves). During a debriefing with Padre Ramirez I was told that areal photos taken in 1959 by the USAF showed the peak without the crater. Thus some significant activity must have taken place between 1959 and 1966. When I climbed it again in 1968 (with a companion this time) the crater was still there and a bit larger. Back in the '60s, there was much more snow and ice on the mountain than in the photo you publish. Climate change or volcanic activity?

Mount Sparrowhawk can be a scramble or ski and is in both the "Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies" book as well as Chic Scott’s "Canadian Rockies Summits and Icefields". I chose to go in between these seasons making an interesting trip of it. Park along the Smith-Dorrien (Spray Lakes Road) Trail approximately 23 km south of Canmore (gravel road). If snow is not blocking the entrance, you can park in the Mount Sparrowhawk picnic turnoff, otherwise park several hundred meters south of this location along the road. Route Description Ski or hike parallel to Sparrowhawk Creek through sparse trees on a bench above the left bank for about a 300’ gain and then leave the creek as it curves right and proceed straight up into the forest due east. Continue through the trees gradually gaining elevation to reach the top of a beautiful vista of Alpine growth, Aspens and Larches with 360 degree views at 8000’. You are at the bottom of a cirque of sorts. To the left is avalanche danger below cliffs, stay right and aim for a break just under an east facing large rock thrust called Reeds Tower. Descend into the bowl and ascend to the col of Reeds Tower at approximately 8800’ and gain the more moderate angled slopes above. Ascend the upper west slopes of Mount Sparrowhawk aiming for the right side of the summit block, approximately 1300’ elevation gain. You cannot ski the last 300’ on the southeast corner of the summit block, but it can be ascended in winter or summer. Return the same. The descent can be rapid, particularly if you have an alpine ax and can find the wind blown crust. Of course if you have skis, you will be back in time for another cappuccino. Mount Sparrowhawk can hold tons of snow during any season. I ascended during September and would rather have carried skis or snowshoes for the final 2000’. I was in waist deep snow on the low angled slopes. I definitely recommend this as a ski outing in winter versus a scramble in summer. Mount Sparrowhawk is connected via a long southeastern ridge to Mount Bogart, a popular pyramid shaped landmark in the heart of Kananaskis Country.

It has two summits: East(7181m, 23559ft) and West(7023m, 23041ft), with 2km's long Ridge between them. Its native name is Jobu Garu or Quageru, but in 1951, when the first westerners, Eric Shipton and Mike Ward, visited the Menlung Valley, it got one more: Menlungtse. Five jagged ridges stretch out from the summit: North-East, South-East, South, South-West and North-West. On the South side the massif is bordered by the Kongbu Rebusan glacier. The approaches to the mountain are: from Nepal over the Manlung La pass(5510m, 18077ft), yet an easier way is from Tibet by vehicle along the Rongxar valley. in Spring abundant snows force travelers to make a detour or foot over the Fula Shan pass (5411m, 17752ft). The traditional basecamp called "Bapu" is at 4700m, 15400ft) opposite to the other beautiful peak:the slightly lower Gauri Shankar(7134m, 23405ft). Owing to the winds from the Indian Ocean, the area is warm and wet with a lot of precipitation. Nearly all the attempts at Menlungtse have been made in the springtime, pre-monsoon (April, May) Despite approaches in 87, 88 (both Chris Bonington) and 1990 (USA) the principal summit was first ascended by a Slovenian party: Andrej Stremfelj and Marco Prezelj, two of the best climbers of Slovenia.

The first climbers of this mountain, also climbed neighboring Udren Zom, which is slighly higher.

Myanmar was until 1987 known as Burma. The summittip borders also Tibet and India. The mountain is an extension of the Eastern Himalayas. Although low in comparison with Himalayan giants Hkakabo Razi is perennialy snowcapped. Hkakabo Razi lies in the Hkakabo Razi protected area, established in 1996 which covers over 3812 square kilometres. Before 1993 this area was not allowed to foreigners. The first recorded attempt was made in 1995 by Takashai Ozaki, from Japan. He failed due to persistent bad weather. A year later he returned, and this time succeded. Nyama Gyaltsen from Myanmar made it too. Like the main Himalayas, these mountains are heavily affected by the monsoon. Hkakabo Razi is certainly not a walkup. Huge cliffs with D+ climbing, hanging glaciers with large crevasses, and corniches, makes it a mountain not to be toyed with. The approach to the mountain is a major obstacle: Streams have to crossed over instable bridges, over huge gorges. For the most part, journeys are made on foot along footpaths that hug the mountainsides and wind through dense jungle undergrowth.

In the Everest region(Khumbu) only Kwangde and Kusum Kangguru are more difficult. The main peak of Lobuche, however is to the NW of Lobuche East and is not included in the trekking peak permit. Therefore, a legal climb to Lobuche West (Main) requires an expedition-peak-permit and is considerable more expensive than Lobuche East. Now follows a description of Lobuche East (20075ft, 6119m 27° 57′ 34.2″ N, 86° 47′ 23.8″ E). Very few climbers who attempt this peak reach the real summit, but many attain the worth-while false summit. Good conditions and a dawn or pre-dawn start is recommended. The average angle for the rocky slabs above the lake (high camp) at about 16,500' to the start of the snow ridge at around 18,600' average 45 to 50 degrees and the route is marked with cairns. This is nice for alpine starts. These rock slabs could be tricky with snow on the rock and there are a couple of moves as you approach the SW ridge that parties may want to be roped up to surmount. It is better to avoid the south west face unless you are looking for more of a challenge. Most climbers who take the SW ridge approach stop at the top of the ridge and consider this to be the false summit of Lobuche East. To reach the true summit of Lobuche East, which is a continuation on the knife-edged ridge heading north west, a rope is recommended due to the exposure. A fall here would be disasterous. There is a slight descent from the false summit along the NW ridge and then a steep climb to the highest point on the long summit ridge. This is a couple of rope lenghts at most. From the true East summit, you will see more knife edge ridge leading NW to a massive notch that separates Lobuche East from Lobuche West, which is higher. The true summit proved to be, at first, an unatainable goal, but rocky outliners of Lobuche East were first climbed by the Swiss in 1952. Subsequent attempts fell short of the summit, finally climbed in 1984. Lobuche West was first climbed in 1955, by the South shoulder, which was also the first attempt. Since then the mountain has been scaled only a few times, also by the East-Face.\nBest months for climbing: Apr, May, Sep, Oct, Nov\nConvenient Center: Namche Bazaar, Nepal\n	\N	Basic Snow/Ice Climb	6119	Lobuche East	Nepal	\N	Central Nepal Himalaya	1

The name Nup-tse is tibetan and means west-peak, as it is the western part of the Lhotse-Nuptse-massif. The main ridge, which is separated from Lhotse by a 7556m high saddle, is crowned by 7 peaks and goes west-northwest until its steep west-face drops down more than 2300m to the Khumbu-glacier. The steep and rocky south-face of Nuptse is 2500m high and 5 kilometers wide. The north slopes are rising from the Western-Cwm valley with the upper part of the Khumbu-glacier above its famous icefall. From there the main summit Nuptse I (7861m) was first climbed on the north-ridge (called Scott-route) on May 16, 1961 by Dennis Davis and Sherpa Tashi from a british expedition.

It appears to be a rather typical peak of the Virginian Appalachians at first glance, but appearances can be deceiving. Most popular perhaps for its gruesome trail up the northern slopes (which just so happens to be the Appalachian Trail), the Priest towers nearly 3000 ft. over the foothills of VA to the immediate east. Many people start from the Tye River parking area to the north and ascend out of the gorge for four miles and 3000 ft. to the Priest's summit. The route is considered by many to be one of the most rigorous climbs along the 2000 mile Appalachian Trail. With dozens of switchbacks and unforgiving grades, this may very well be true. Infact commiting to this route is often refered to as "doing the Priest" and is a considerable accomplishment if one succeeds. Thick vegetation eliminates most of the views from the top, but there is a rock outcropping close to a mile from the summit that provides an expansive vista to the east (and a good place to take a water break).

Mount Chester shares the range with many other climbs including: Gusty Peak, Mount Engadine, The Fortress, Mount Galatea and Mount Lawson. Mount Chester is one of the more common scrambling objectives in Kananaskis Provincial Park due in part to Chester Lake being one of the more popular day hike destinations. Mount Chester was named after a WW I battleship which is common for peaks in this section of Kananaskis. It is an easy scramble by Canadian Rocky standards. The only published route is the scramble route. The same access, Chester Lake Trail, can be used to access a variety of scrambles including The Fortress, Mount Galatea and Gusty Peak. Directly across Spray Lakes Road is the common Burstall Pass Trail with access to Mount Murray and Mount Burstall. The views are far reaching in this section of Kananaskis. Directly southwest you have uninterrupted views of Mount Sir Douglas. Getting There From the Canmore Nordic Center, drive 40kms+/- south on the Spray Lakes/Smith Dorrien Road (gravel). Turn left at a sign for the Chester Lake day use parking lot. You are almost guaranteed mountain sheep on the Spray Lakes Road and if you are lucky a moose or two. I witnessed a moose and her calf cross the road about 3kms past Goat Creek Trail. I saw this same female without a calf two years prior. Watch for hazardous rock fall on the switchbacks above Canmore. At times this road will be closed due to rock and/or mud slides. There are restrooms at the Chester Lake day use parking lot. Red Tape There are no permit requirements to enter, climb and/or park in Kananaskis Provincial Park. This is active grizzly country however. Take bear spray. There have been numerous 2005 trail closures in Kananaskis due to mountain lions and grizzlies. Therefore it would be prudent to check recent notices posted on the park’s website. The park headquarters is actually located on Highway 40 (Kananaskis Trail). When To Climb As with most climbs in the Canadian Rockies, the driest time is from June through September. I scrambled Mount Chester in September and the route was mostly dry. There are no published backcountry ski routes on Mount Chester. Camping Kananaskis officials have closed all camping at Chester Lake. The closest camping is located back at the north end of Spray Lakes Reservoir across the dam at random campsites marked on the west shore of the lake. You cannot camp outside of the marked specific camping areas in Kananaskis. Refer to the Kananaskis Provincial Park website for more information regarding camping and/or lodging. A premium accommodation is the Engadine Lodge (back at Mount Shark road) which is only several kilometers north. Mountain Conditions The Kananaskis Provincial Park website is a very thorough park website, including trail conditions or closures, wildlife notices, weather conditions, avalanche conditions, camping permits, whitewater conditions, etc. It is an excellent source if you are going to spend any time here and comparable to any National Park website I have used.

Interestingly, this mountain bears Guyot's name although he was presumably not the first person to reach its summit. While an aboriginal ascent is debatable, the frontier between NC and TN was first surveyed in 1821-- a full decade before Guyot himself began a systematic topographical study of the region. Today, despite the passage of well over a century and a half, this peak is still remote. The venerable Appalachian Trail passes along the high flanks of Mt. Guyot, but leaves the summit save for those hikers willing to ditch their packs and forge through a dense Frasier Fir forest via an overgrown manway. And for such intrepid souls, tagging the USGS benchmark is the primary reward, as views are non-existant; but, on the other hand, expending the energy to reach the top is worth something else: the satisfaction (and bragging rights)of bagging the rarely visited second highest peak in the US's most heavily used National Park.\nBest months for climbing: Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct\nConvenient Center: Cosby, TN\n	\N	Walk up	2018	Mt.

Mount Tyrwhitt was officially named n 1918 after a WWI Admiral, common for the mountains in this region. Tyrwhitt was first ascended by the legendary Canadian climber Conrad Kain along with Westmorland and Campbell in 1914. Mount Tyrwhitt’s elevated start at Highwood Pass (7239’) and approach through golden Larches make it one of the most scenic short routes in the Canadian Rockies. Adding to its popularity is a most unique natural arch feature called the “Window” found on its east ridge. The only published route up Tyrwhitt is the moderate scramble and this route takes you right by this feature. You can schedule this scramble for a short day and return on the east ridge, but I highly recommend combining it with a traverse over to Mount Pocaterra and descend the route from there making it a true cirque. You are treated to great views of the Height of Rockies group, including Mount Joffre to the west as well as the Misty Range of Mount Rae, Storm Mountain and Mount Arethusa to the east. Getting There Take the Kananaskis Trail (Highway 40) exit off of the Trans-Canada Highway between Calgary and Canmore. Drive to the Highwood Pass day parking area at 7239’ (Highwood Pass Interpretive Trail) and park. Restrooms are at this location. Kananaskis Trail is closed from December 1 through June 15, and I do mean with a gate. The closure is at Kings Creek (Canyon), meaning no access to any of the Highwood area mountains prior to June 15th. In my opinion, this Highwood Pass area serves up the most scenic and accessible high alpine foliage in all of the Canadian Rockies. Red Tape There are no permit requirements to enter, climb and/or park in Kananaskis Provincial Park. This is active grizzly country however. Take bear spray. As of July, 2005, we have current trail closures in this area of Kananaskis due to a mountain lion (protecting its kill) and grizzly with cubs (bluff charge). Therefore it is prudent to check recent notices posted on the bulletin board outside of park headquarters which you drive by on Highway 40 (Kananaskis Trail). If they are open, check in with the ranger staff, they have tons of beta and are always friendly. When To Climb As with most climbs in the Canadian Rockies, the driest time is from June through September. I climbed Mount Tyrwhitt in September and the route was free of snow. There are no published backcountry ski routes on Mount Tyrwhitt, nor would I suspect this to be a mountain worth skiing. Camping The closest camping is a backcountry site at Elbow Lake, 1.3 km in on Big Elbow Trail back north a few kilometers off of Hwy 40. There are tons of camping options further north at Kananaskis Lakes. You cannot camp outside of the marked specific camping areas in Kananaskis. Refer to the Kananaskis Provincial Park website for more information regarding camping and/or lodging. Mountain Conditions The Kananaskis Provincial Park website is a very thorough park website, including trail conditions or closures, wildlife notices, weather conditions, avalanche conditions, camping permits, whitewater conditions, etc. It is an excellent source if you are going to spend any time here and comparable to any National Park website I have used.

Banff National Park is one of four connecting national parks that make up the heart of the Canadian Rockies. Kananaskis Provincial Park encompasses over 4,000 square kilometers of foothills and mountains bordering Banff National Park to the east. EEOR is the unofficial name of the east end of the 15km Mount Rundle massif. Its short gain from Goats Creek trailhead and proximity to Canmore make it a popular objective. EEOR has many published routes of varying difficulty besides the common scramble. Its north face consists of a long 500 meter cliff overlooking Canmore. Although several of the routes boast above average rock to climb on via Rocky Mountain standards, the natural rock fall from above presents a serious hazard on EEOR. There is also a traverse of the entire Mount Rundle massif that is typically performed east to west but is not a typical objective by any means. In fact beta on the route is almost non-existent. EEOR is directly north (across Spray Lakes Road) of Ha Ling Peak, another common scramble objective with north face trad routes. Getting There From the Canmore Nordic Center, ascend the Spray Lakes/Smith Dorrien road (gravel) through the switchbacks to the Goats Creek Trail head past the dam and reservoir. You are almost guaranteed mountain sheep on the Spray Lakes Road. I have even been charged by a ram as I was running up the road (long story). Watch for hazardous rock fall on the switchbacks above Canmore. At times this road will be closed due to rock and/or mud slides. There are restrooms at the Goats Creek Trail head parking area. Red Tape There are no permit requirements to enter, climb and/or park in Banff National Park or Kananaskis Provincial Park. This is active grizzly country however. Take bear spray. There have been numerous 2005 trail closures in Banff and Kananaskis due to mountain lions and grizzlies. Therefore it would be prudent to check recent notices posted on the park's website(s). When To Climb As with most climbs in the Canadian Rockies, the driest time is from June through September. One can scramble EEOR most any month out of the year depending on conditions. I scrambled EEOR in June several different years. One year I got pelted with hail and visibility was near zero at the summit. There are no published backcountry ski routes on EEOR. Camping The closest camp site would be back in Canmore at the town campsite at the information center off of the same exit for Harvie Heights. The Alpine Club of Canada national office is located in Canmore and also serves as a hostel, a recently renovated one at that. You cannot camp outside of the marked specific camping areas in Banff National Park or Kananaskis Provincial Park. Refer to the park website(s) for more information regarding backcountry camping.

When you reach the ridge, you simply follow it for a couple of hundred metres, until you reach av spot where a rapell can be the easiest way if you are bringing a rope. Without a rope it will be necessary to cross this spot in the left, you go down some 20-30 metres and follow back to the ridge again. The rest is relatively easy, just following the ridge, before you scramble the last part up to the top. There are also two more Skagsnebb tops(V-1 and V-2) further west, just following the ridge.

Therefore, it is one of the most impressive peaks as viewed from Highway 40 heading south (Kananaskis Highway) and holds more snow and ice than the neighboring mountains. Mount Bogart was officially named in 1928 after a geologist who was one of the first scientists to study the Rockies. However, it was also unofficially named The Pyramid due to its triangular summit. Mount Bogart is connected via a northern long ridge to Mount Sparrowhawk, a popular scramble/back country ski mountain accessed via the Spray Lake Reservoir. Mount Bogart’s summit can be easily viewed from the Kananaskis Village turnoff of Highway 40. The route however takes you on a long approach toward the south side of the mountain via Ribbon Creek Trail. The only published route is a long moderate to difficult scramble (depending on snow and ice conditions). It is a 5500’+/- ascent day more than likely encountering strong, if not voracious, winds. Getting There Take the Kananaskis Trial (Highway 40) exit off of the Trans-Canada Highway between Calgary and Canmore. Travel 23.4 km south on Highway 40 and turn right into Kananaskis Village and follow the signs to the Ribbon Creek parking lot. Take your bike for the long approach. Red Tape There are no permit requirements to enter, climb and/or park in Kananaskis Country. This is active grizzly country however. Take bear spray. You drive by the park headquarters on the way in on Highway 40. Any recent notices will be posted on the bulletin board outside. If they are open, check in with the ranger staff, they have tons of beta and are always friendly. When To Climb This can be a harsh mountain and is therefore a summer scramble. Try from late June through September. I climbed the mountain in October and faced considerable ice. Camping You can make this a long day trip or sleep in style at the Ribbon Creek Hostel, just walking distance to the trail head. Or really go all out and stay at the posh Delta Lodge in Kananaskis Village. There are campgrounds available as well, including a very nice campsite 11 km in route, Ribbon Falls. You cannot camp outside of the marked specific camping areas in Kananaskis. Refer to the Kananaskis Provincial Park website for more information regarding camping or lodging. Mountain Conditons The Kananaskis Provincial Park website is a very thorough park website, including trail conditions or closures, wildlife notices, weather conditions, avalanche conditions, camping permits, whitewater conditions, etc. It is an excellent source if you are going to spend any time here and comparable to any National Park website I have used.\nConvenient Center: Canmore, Alberta\n	Alberta	Scramble	3144	Mount Bogart	Canada	\N	Canadian Rockies	1

At 3162 feet, Scafell is actually England's second highest peak, that honour going to neighbouring Scafell Pike. From many angles though - notably from the top of Scafell Pike, Scafell can appear the higher summit and it certainly presents a more imposing facade with the grey rock walls of Scafell Crag and Deep Ghyll Buttress on its northern side. The mountain is usually climbed from Wasdale or Eskdale being situated on the south western side of the Lake District and has a choice of routes to its summit. The most well known - that of Lord's Rake - has in recent years, been affected by rock fall and it would be worth checking locally as to its safety if this is your intended way. The ridge via Slight Side to the south is a fine outing with good views and the Cam Spout/Foxes Tarn route is an interesting ascent from Eskdale. This is also now the normal way from Wasdale and involves crossing Mickledore first. A word of warning! If ascending from Wasdale or crossing Mickledore to Scafell Pike, Foxes Tarn is the walkers route. Broad Stand, though short, is a rock climb - not a walk and attempting it unroped is dangerous if you're not an experienced climber!

There are many peaks of similar hight in the Oetztaler Alps, including Wildspitze 12,362ft/3768m and Weisskugel(on the border with Italy) 12,263ft/3738m: respectively the 2nd highest and 3rd highest peaks of Austria. Ramolkogel is the highest one in the Ramolkamm (kamm = ridge) and is climbed often from both the NW side (Vent 6,217ft/1895m)and the E side ( Obergurgl) 6,256ft/1907m). The normal routes come together at the Ramoljoch, a glaciated col at 10,462ft/3189m. The approach from Vent is easiest. After the col easy rock and mixed climbing over the small, middle summits, the last part steeper. From both the villages of Vent and Obergurgl this tour can be done in one day (to the summit and back). Alternative route (easier) from Vent directly up the W-side. This side is largely glacierfree and not to steep. From about 3450m/11,300ft up the ice and then (rocky)onto the summit. This route is a lot more direct and has much less rock climbing and not as well-known as are the normal routes. Most other peaks in this area are even less complicated f.a.: Wildspitze, Weisseespitze, Similaun, Fineilspizte and other mountains above 11,000ft/3500m., but glacier experience is still necessary. More difficult peaks are situated to the north in the Kaunergrat area: Watzespitze, Verpeilspize, Rofelewand, where the mountains are slightly lower ( the highest are about or just higher than 11,000ft) have a lot smaller glaciers but have more dramatic shapes.\nBest months for climbing: Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Vent , Obergurgl\n	\N	Basic Snow/Ice Climb	3549	Ramolkogel	Austria	\N	Otztal Alps	1

Its sheer wall of red rock rises powerfully from forested slopes. It is the largest and highest mountain of the Guiana Highlands. The borders of Brazil, Guiana and Venezuela meet on the mountain. Roraima is a mysterious, often misty mountain, the perfect setting for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel Lost World. I wanted to make you know a little bit of information about the "Tepuy", like Pemons indians say. Name It has to be the name the indians give to the mountain and it is "Roraima tepuy". Elevation The highest elevation in meters registered there, is 2.810 meters. Location The tepuy is almost complete located in Venezuela, like you will see in the map I send. I think is better if you go to Venezuela first, because to climb the mountain there is just one way and it's at Venezuela's side, so is better going to Caracas and after to Santa Elena de Uairen, (by plane), because if you go to Brazil first you have to cross the nation limit (frontiers) without need it and is really boring.\nBest months for climbing: Jan, Feb, Mar, Nov, Dec\nConvenient Center: Santa Elena de Uairén, Venezuela\n	\N	Scramble	2810	Tepuy Roraima	Venezuela/Brazil	\N	La Gran Sabana	1

The South Face is a moderate trad paradise with two-pitch routes in the 5.6-5.9 range. Harder routers are also available, but be sure you know how to undercling as this face is notorious for its "eye-brow" pockets. Imagine a piece of Pita bread, cut in half and tilted downward; that's a classic brow! Sloper on the bottom, undercling as you move upward, and cams placed in horizontal slots; that's climbing at the Glass. Also, be confident in your ability to smear, as the excellent granite lends itself to this type of footwork. Oh, and by the way, the crack systems on this face are continuous, but tend more toward being water grooves than true cracks; there is the occasional fingerlock, but don't tape up for jamming! This wall, due to its exposure, is an excellent place hang-out during the winter. It is possible to climb on this wall year-round, although during the summer the granite slab is somewhat like a vertical parking lot. The Nose area is home to longer classics, such as the Glass's original line, the eponymic Nose route. As at the South Face, the climbing is on steep slab perforated with brows and periodically channeled with a watergroove/"crack." In addition to being the home of true multi-pitch routes, this wall is also a better choice than the South Face during the heat and humidity of July, August, and September. The scene here is also a little less boisterous, as summer camps, school groups, Outward Bound parties, and the miscelaneous guided groups that frequent the South Face are rarer here. If you like aid climbing, check out the North Face. Home to such classics as "Glass Menagerie" and "Invisible Airwaves," this is one of the Southeast's premier (and only) places to break out the aiders, RURPs, and hooks. The left-hand side of this wall also has classic free climbs-- "Safari Jive," for instance. Even more secluded is Hidden Wall. Approached by the same trail as that leading to the North Face, this wall has some excellent, remote free climbs. Both the North Face and Hidden Wall are excellent places to beat the summer heat, but can be cold as the proverbial witch's titty during the late fall, winter, and early spring.\nBest months for climbing: Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Sep, Oct, Nov\nConvenient Center: Pisgah Forrest, NC\n	\N	Walk up	1210	Looking Glass Rock	United States	North Carolina	Blue Ridge Mountains	1

From the summit of Khartse, some miles to the NE of Everest, on the north side of the stunning Kangshung valley, George Mallory concluded, that the East or Kangshung-face of Everest was to dangerous to climb for sensible people. Today it is still considered to be the most dangerous side of Everest, due to the avalanche risks. Mallory was the best known of the team. He died on an Everest attempt in 1924 together with climbingpartner Andrew Ervine. Mallory's remainings weren't found until 1999!. Kartse can be easily climbed, if well aclimatised (you'll have to in Tibet, anyway). The easy routes are from the Kharta Glacier, for instance from the East, the first ascent route. The SW face, from the Kangshung glacier is a lot more dangerous and difficult: a very steep hangingglacier. Khartse is probably only climbed one time, and the Kharta glacier area was until recently extremely remote. But know there is a new organized Everest-trek that leads over the Khartaglacier, over the Lhakpa-La a very high Col at about 22,500ft/6900m. But this route is not frequented, because of the climbing skills needed at both sides of the Lhakpa-La and the extremely high altitude for a trek. it is a fact that reaching the summit of Kartse is less difficult. To the North of Kartse rises Khartaphu, a peak over 7200m. To the south lies the Kangshungvaley where 3 of the worlds five highest mountains rise: Everest, Lhotse and Makalu.\nBest months for climbing: Apr, May, Sep, Oct\nConvenient Center: Kharta(?), Tingri\n	\N	Basic Snow/Ice Climb	6507	Kartse	China	\N	Central Nepal Himalaya	1

It was once much higher, but a violent eruption in 1912 collapsed the mountain. Its crater today is eight miles in circumference and 3,700 feet deep, and holds a lake with a small island. It rises near the shore of the Shelikof Straight, across which Kodiak Island can be seen. Aniakchak and the Aleutian Islands are further south on the same peninsula. The valley surrounding Katmai is known as the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes because of the widespread steam and smoke which have risen from the valley floor for much of this century.

The complete trail is 16 km long, a seven or eight hour hike at a leisurely pace. To fully enjoy the wildlife and spectacular scenery along this trail, be sure to allow yourself enough time. Growing on Gros Morne's summit is a slice of Arctic tundra far south of its usual range.

It is a huge dome, now dormant, that dominates the range, more in girth than in height. Its name in Kinyaruanda means white shell, which refers to its often white-capped summit. Interestingly, this cap results not from snow but from hail and sleet which accumulate in the higher elevations from its frequent storms. It is located within the Parc National Des Volcans, and many of the volcanoes are connected by good trails. Additional text submitted by Al Smiles: Karisimbi is the highest of the eight major volcanoes of the Virunga field, a western branch of the East African rift valley.This stratovolcano is part of a group of volcanoes in the Bufumbira field which is an eastern region of Virunga. Karisimbi lavas have been dated from 0.24 Ma to 0.010 Ma. These samples indicate that this volcano is a very young.

The mountain has religious significance for several religions, owing in part to a rock indentation on the summit that is shaped like a large human foot. This was said by early Christians to be the footprint of Adam, a belief inherited by Moslems when they assumed rule of the island. Later, Buddhists said the indentation was the footprint of the Buddha, and Hindus said it was the footprint of Siva. With all these traditions finding religious reason to respect this mountain, it is not surprising that it is visited by thousands of pilgrims each week, and has been for over two thousand years. There are 3,306 steps leading to the summit from the town of Dalhouse, and vendors sell refreshments and other goods along the trail. The trail from the southeast has no steps, but it too has trail vendors, and both trails have streetlights all the way to the top for those seeking a night hike in comfortable temperatures. The summit footprint is now enclosed by a shrine that is inhabited by Buddhist monks.

This mountain is distinctive in that it's broad dome dominates the countryside. Blue Knob is the most northern of the 3,000 footers in the Allegheny Mountain range. Until 1921, Blue Knob was believed to be the highest mountain in the Commonwealth. The U.S. Geological Survey then determined that a point on Negro Mountain, in Somerset County, to be higher at 3,213 feet (979 m), later named Mount Davis. Blue Knob contains a vast network of hiking trails that range from easy walks to difficult and challenging day hikes. The total network of trails is approximately 18 miles in length. Most of these trails are multiple use for hiking, cross country skiing, mountain biking, horseback riding and snowmobiling. Below is a brief description of each trail that can be found on the mountain. Mountain View Trail This trail is 5 miles in length and one of the more difficult on the mountain. It is marked with a double red blaze and the trailhead can be found on the Tower Road just below the summit. The Mountain View Trail begins at about the 3,000 ft. contour and begins by looping around a gentle grade on the upper portion of the mountain's east shoulder. This part of the mountain is marked by stunted and wind deformed trees, mainly scrub oak and striped maple. Also large slabs of the conglomerate rocks that form this mountain may be seen strewn about on these upper slopes. This trail passes two lookouts, the Pavia Overlook and the Queen Overlook before desending into the Beaverdam Creek drainage and the lowest portion of this trail at the 2,000 ft. contour. The trail then traverses the east face of the mountain to the Willow Springs picnic area before it begins its steep ascent on the west face of the mountain and back to the trailhead. Three Springs Trail This trail is 2 miles in length and follows and old roadbed. The trail is wide and good for snowmobiles and horseback riding. This trail can be accessed from the Mountain View Trail at about the 3,050 ft. contour and generally runs downslope before it bisects the east face, and ends at the 2,500 ft. contour where it junctions once again with the Mountain View Trail. Along its length you can see how the trail got its name by the number of springs that are used for supplying water to the villages below the mountain. Rock N' Ridge Trail This trail begins at the 1,550 ft. contour just above the gated entrance to the park headquarters. It is 2.8 miles in length and marked by an inverted blue "T". The trail is located on the west side of the mountain and begins by following a ridge that abutts the main dome of the mountain. On this trail you may see mountain laurel which is the Pennsylvania State Flower. When the mountain laurel blooms in June it makes for a very scenic hike. The trail eventually junctions into the Sawmill trail at the 2,400 ft. contour, before this however, the trail has a turnoff which will descend down the Pavia Run drainage and end at the Mowry Hollow Picinc Area. Sawmill Trail The Sawmill Trail crosses the west face of the mountain and is 3 miles in length marked by yellow blazes. This is another wide trail that follows an old roadbed and is conducive to snowmobiles and mountain biking. The trailheads are located at either end of the trail off the Knob Road or on State Route 403 on Ickes Hill. If you begin on Ickes Hill, you will begin ascending the southwest buttress of the mountain to the Willow Springs Picinic Area at the 2,250 ft. contour. From there you will navigate shortly on the Mountain View Trail before you again pick up the Sawmill Trail. The trail moves across the hollows of the moutain at approximately the 2,400 ft. contour before it ends at that north end of Chappel Field and the trail head on the Knob Road. This hike takes you through rich hardwoods and passes over mountain seeps which drain from the upper slopes of the mountain, it is one of the easier hikes in the park. Homestead Trail This trail is a small loop at 1.8 miles in length and marked by orange blazes. The Homestead Trail may be gained by access off the Whysong Road or by a connector trail off the Sawmill Trail. The hike is on the lower portions of the mountain and only gains to the 2,100 ft. contour. The trail is easy and wide open and as its name suggests, marks the site of an old settlers house site. Hiking along this pathway affords good opportunities for viewing wildlife. Chappell's Field Trail The Chappell's Field Trail is accessible at points on the Knob Road and campground areas. The trail is located on one of the main ridges that are found on the west side of the mountain. On the top of this ridge, which is over 2,400 ft., Chapell's Field holds one of the best views in the park as it looks up at the main summit of Blue Knob and down on the valley below. The trail encircles the top of this ridge and is 2.5 miles in length, a loop marked by inverted orange "V" blazes. Crist Ridge Trail The 1.9 mile orange blazed trail connects to the Chappell's Field Trail at the 2,250 ft. contour and winds its way down the ridge ending on the Knob Road. This trail had large areas of blowdowns on it following the wind events in September of 2004. Since then the trail has been cleared and is a good trail for mountain biking and cross country skiing. In the winter with the foliage down, views of Blue Knob Mountain can be seen through the trees. Lost Turkey Trail This is the longest and most difficult trail at 26 miles long. The trail begins on 3,034 foot Herman Point and is marked by red blazes. The trail crosses over both public and private lands as it eventually ends in neighboring Somerset County. To begin this hike you must proceed up the Tower Road and pass by the gated road which leads to Herman Point and the transmitter towers on its summit. Just behind the fenced in towers, you can see the trail which proceeds down the steep face of the mountain into the Rhodes Run drainage. From here the trail follows Ciana Run before crossing Hogback ridge, then beginning its steep ascent up Forks Ridge and the Allegheny Front beyond. Once on top of the Allegheny Plateau it winds its way through high elevation forests and mountain bogs. Proper footwear is recommended for this hike as it is steep in some areas and stream crossings are required along its length. Connector Trails There are several connector trails that make up the remaining mileage on Blue Knob's trails system. They are double blue blazed markings and vary in length and difficulty.\nBest months for climbing: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct\nConvenient Center: Bedford\n	\N	Walk up	956	Blue Knob	United States	Pennsylvania	Allegheny Mountains	1

The views make this special. JE Skiddaw, England's fourth highest peak, rises to the North of Keswick and is the most prominent fell seen from there - its vast bulk contributing considerably to the sheltered climate enjoyed along the shores of Derwentwater - if also to the rainfall. The most popular ascent route is by the tourist route from the Latrigg car park following a wide track past Skiddaw Little Man to the summit.

The town of Zermatt, nestled beneath the mountain's north face, is a mountaineering Mecca. One of the most frequently climbed mountains in the world, the Matterhorn's every ridge and face have been scaled, and there are now fixed ropes, ladders, and huts along the normal routes to the summit. Don't let these props, however, provide false security, because much of the climb still requires a great deal of technical expertise, and its death rate is one of the highest in the world. The isolation of the mountain results in its forming its own weather, which can change rapidly; it is possible for a storm to be raging on the Matterhorn when conditions in the region as a whole are good. One of the largest dangers on the Matterhorn is its popularity, since large numbers of climbers ascending simultaneously guarantees that meeting and overtaking maneuvers will be required, and increases the likelihood that rocks will be dislodged onto lower climbers. (There is much loose rock on the mountain). Edward Whymper and party's first ascent of the mountain ended in tragedy, as the Rev Charles Hudson, Douglas Hadow, Lord Francis Douglas, and the guide Michel Croz all fell to their deaths on the descent. Only Whymper himself and two Swiss guides (Taugwalder father and son) survived. Lord Francis Douglas' body has never been recovered. It was the English who made the resort of Zermatt popular with tourists. Here they came hiring locals as guides to guide them towards and often up their chosen mountain. Zermatt is surrounded by many 4000 metre mountains, and these were all climbed during the 'Golden Age' of mountaineering around 1850. The Matterhorn stood aloof for many years after repeated attempts from both Italy and Switzerland. The ascent of this mountain became a symbol of national pride, and wherever it was first climbed from (either Cervinia in Italy, or Zermatt in Switzerland), would reap the benefits from the tourist trade. There are now many routes to the summit of the Matterhorn, the least difficult being the first ascent route: Hornli Ridge (AD), and the Lion (Italian)Ridge (AD+). However these grades would be much harder were it not for long sections of fixed ropes and ladders to enable local guides to get their clients up as quickly as possible. Away from the popular 'Voies Normales' the experienced climber may tackle classic routes such as the Zmutt and Furggen Ridges (D), while even more experienced climbers can test their skills on the North Face (ED1). Today the Matterhorn remains a significant challenge that should never be underestimated by climbers. The Matterhorn's familiar shape invites more comparison than perhaps any other peak in the world, including Ama Dablam in the Himalaya, Ushba in the Caucasus, Canada's Mount Assiniboine, and Peru's Jirishanca. Note that the description in Wikipedia of the ascent of the Hornli Ridge as a "scramble" is dangerously misleading. It is a long climb on a high mountain with unstable rock and variable snow conditions. To climb it without guides demands fitness, technical skill, understanding of safety techniques and general mountaineering competence. Many people die each year on this mountain.\nBest months for climbing: Jul, Aug, Sep\nConvenient Center: Zermatt, Switzerland\n	\N	Technical Climb	4478	Matterhorn	Switzerland/Italy	\N	Savoy Alps	1

Just west of Cho Oyu is the Nangpa La, a 19,000-foot glacier pass, the main trade route between the Khumbu Sherpas and Tibet.

Once you get to the top, you see why the local Massai tribe believe it is the home of their God, Ngai. A shallow crater filled with recently solidified lava that has oozed like molten chocolate, with cracks and fumaroles emitting blasts of scorching, sulfurous air. The time I climbed the Mountain of God, we fronted the rim of the crater, and at that moment, a blast from deep within the mountain shook the ground and smoke came out of a fumarole. Ngai was telling us to walk with respect. The lava was so fresh, it melted the soles of my boots. Someone once remarked that because the lava on Lengai was so unusual on Lengai, it came out at a temperature of 700 degrees Celsius.

Sepu Kangri itself was the subject of two failed summit bids in 1997 and 1998, both expeditions led by Sir Chris Bonington, CBE. In 1998 Victor Saunders and Scott Muir were just 150m below the summit before bad weather made them retreat. Heavy snow fall in 1997 resulted in the team having to turn back at an altitude of 6050m reached by Chris Bonington and jim Lowther. For the time being Sepu Kangri remains an unclimbed peak, possibly the last great climb remaining in the world today.\nBest months for climbing: Apr, May, Aug, Sep, Oct\nConvenient Center: Diru (Biru)\n	\N	Major Mountain Expedition	6995	Sepu Kangri	China	\N	\N	1

Villages, towns, and industry have been erected at the mountain's base and agriculture continues on its slopes, despite occasional threats from the mountain, such as minor eruptions of 1792, 1851, and a major eruption of 1902. The 1902 eruption rained hot lava and molten rock on the city of St. Pierre on Ascension Day, a religious festival that had drawn nearly 29,000 people to the town. According to legend, only one person survived the eruption, he being a condemned prisoner whose cell apparently provided him protection. Upon his being found four days later, he was released from custody. Contrary to legend, however, somewhere between 60 and 120 people are believed to have survived (see 'Vulcan's Fury' by Alwyn Scarth). In either case, survival rate still figured at less than 3%, making this the world's most deadly volcanic eruption in the twentieth century. Soufriére IV, a volcano on nearby St. Vincent Island, had erupted on the previous day. Mont Pelée's most recent activity was a series of eruptions that occurred from September 1929 through December 1932.\nBest months for climbing: Jan, Mar, Apr, Dec\nConvenient Center: Le Morne Rouge, Martinique\nVolcanic status: Active\n	\N	Scramble	1397	Mont Pelee		\N	\N	1

An ice ax is needed just to safe guard a short stretch at the begining of the climb where a slip (although unlikely) would be dangerous. It is a beautifully sculpted mountain, with gently sloping slopes and rock at the very end (i.e. the last ten feet or so). There is an active glacier just off of the normal route. The normal route goes up a steep creek bed with heather all around. After that you traverse under a short rocky nub. This is the most exposed part of the climb, and although the slope is very gentle, a slip on the dense snow would lead to a fall over the rock band. After turning right around the nub, you continue down to a col. From there it is an easy snow slope to the top. A great peak to ski down.

In the grass lands you encounter innumberable tarns and lakes varying from 2m in diameter to hundreds of metres. The climb is magnificent. The easiest route up to the summit is from the north side and a little place called Kagaba. To get to Kagaba you travel from Mt.Hagen City via Tambul. The drive to Tambul is also magnificent and gives a spectacular view of the peak. This peak is summited far less than Mt.Wilhelm the highest peake in PNG, however is more enjoyable. The local people are very friendly. There is no official or well trodden path to the summits, however the majority of the local people know how to get to the summits.
